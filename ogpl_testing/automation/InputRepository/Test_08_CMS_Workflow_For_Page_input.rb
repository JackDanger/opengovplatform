#$Body="Patna:  The toll that nursery admissions takes, both on parents and young children, is a recurring headline in India.  City after city complains of limited schools, and the cartwheels that harangued parents perform to get their three-year-olds enrolled. In Patna this morning, two young nursery candidates fainted while waiting in line to submit their applications for admission.  Both were rushed to the hospital and are believed to be safe.

#They had queued up with their parents at Mount Carmel, one of the city's most prestigious schools.  Guidelines say children do not need to be present when applications are submitted, but many parents believe it bolsters their case.

#At Mount Carmel, authorities say one counter had been set up to deal with hundreds of parents, triggering an endless wait.   More counters were set up to receive forms after the two children collapsed.
