about the author of a node comment or page from core it collects the user picture name join date online status contact link and profile information in addition it gathers data from many user related contributed modules and puts it together in a modifiable template file installation 1 copy the entire authorpane module directory into your normal directory for modules usually sites all modules 2 enable the author pane module in q admin build modules usage advanced forum if you have advanced forum installed it will make use of author pane automatically on forum posts advanced forum provides its own author pane template and css so it can be styled specifically for use in the forums advanced profile kit if you have advanced profile kit installed it will make use of author pane automatically on the default user page variant advanced profile kit provides its own author pane template so it can be styled specifically for use on profile pages please note that if you remove and readd the author pane content type you will need to edit the pane settings and put advancedprofile back in the caller field ctools content pane if you have page manager from ctools installed you can add the author pane content pane to any page variant it requires the user context you can choose an imagecache preset to use for the user picture you can also use the caller field to give this instance a unique id that can be accessed from the preprocess functions and the template file block there is an author pane block provided that you can enable the block will show up on user nn blog nn and node nn where the node type is one that you allow in the block config if you want to exclude it from one of those page types use the core block visibility option exclusion of the edit page happens automatically the block is disabled by default and must be enabled further options are available by configuring the block node types to display on check on which node types the block should be shown the block will show in the region it is placed not literally on the node and only on full node view pages ie node 42 not when the node is part of a view user picture preset this is the imagecache preset that will be used to format the user picture leave blank to show the full sized picture requires imagecache module theme function you can call the theme function directly and print the author pane anywhere in your code you must have a fully loaded user object to pass into the function the rest of the parameters are optional parameters account the fully loaded user object if all you have is a uid you can get the object with account userload uid where uid is a variable holding the user id caller optional this is an id you can pass in as a way to track who is calling the function if you use author pane on your user profiles on your blog pages and in your forums you may want to display slightly different information in each author pane by passing in the caller you can tell from within the preprocess functions where this is going to be displayed picturepreset optional this is an imagecache picture preset that if given and if imagecache is enabled will be used to size the user picture on the author pane context optional this is usually a node or comment object and gives the context of where the author pane has been placed so information from that context is available to the template and preprocesses disablecss optional because the author pane preprocess gets called after the code that calls it the author pane css file will be loaded last and clobber any earlier css this option tells author pane not to load its css so it uses the css of the caller this is mainly intended for advanced forum because the styles include author pane styling but can be used for custom purposes as well  ',0),(78,'help',' readme readme file for the clone module for drupal 6x the clone module allows users to make a copy of an existing node and then edit that copy the authorship is set to the current user the menu and url aliases are reset and the localized words clone of are inserted into the title to remind you that you are not editing the original node users with the clone node or clone own nodes permission can utilize this functionality a new tab will appear on node pages with the word clone depending on the setting you choose there are two possible actions that will occur when you click that tab each of these is a different cloning method the default method used in the 5x2x branch also works by prepopulating the node form rather than immediately saving a copy of the original node to the database thus your node will not be saved until you hit submit just like if you went to node add x the alternative method that may be selected immediately saves the node by default the user must confirm this action on a confirmation form this may work better in some cases but also means that the copied node may immediately show up on the front page or in rss feeds even while you are editing it this module makes reasonable checks on access permissions a user cannot clone a node unless they can use the input format of that node and unless they have permission to create new nodes of that type based on a call to nodeaccess settings can be accessed at admin settings clone on this page you can set whether the publishing options are reset when making a clone of a node this is set for each node type individually this module seems to work with common node types however ymmv especially with nodes that have any sort of image or file attachments in all cases but especially if you are using a complex cck or custom node type you should evaluate this module on a test site with a copy of your database before attempting to use it on a live site on the settings page you may choose node types to be omitted from the cloning mechanism no users will be able to clone a node of an omitted type this module makes no attempt to respect fieldlevel permissions set via cck s content permissions module or any other module that implements cck fieldlevel permissions hooks you should test your configuration carefully or not allow access to the clone functionality for

you ll most likely want to enable openlayers ui and openlayers views modules for typical uses of openlayers openlayers ui creates a user interface to make map arrays which can be used in various places cck allows integration with cck so that geo data can be inputted via a map views allows data to be displayed on a map via views filters creates a filter to replace openlayers presetname with a map basic concepts presets an openlayers map in drupal is a combination of decisions about which layers to show what styles to apply the minimum and maximum zoom levels and how the user can interact with the map a map preset object is where the options for these settings are combined and stored presets can be rendered through openlayers views of the type openlayers map through filters provided by the openlayers filters module or directly in your modules using the api function openlayersrendermap layers openlayers allows for the display of a variety of raster and vector data on maps these are divided into two categories basemaps and overlays basemaps like those from openstreetmap or google maps provide a background for your data overlays can be data from openlayers data views kml layers or other types of data from external sources for more information on layer types see docs layertypestxt styles the openlayers module currently allows users to define custom styles for vector overlays the primary usecase here will be data from openlayers data views but this could also include kml files styles define things like stroke width background and outline colors and point size and allow the use of icons if desired they must be associated with layers on a per preset basis behaviors behaviors can be enabled on map presets to control how users interact with the map examples of behaviors include navigation which when enabled allows users to zoom and pan and layer switcher which provides a ui that allows users to toggle on and off the layers available on the map openlayers views openlayers views come in two varieties the first is a display type called openlayers data this is what allows users to control which pieces of content show up on the map and in what manner each openlayers data view provides a layer that can be added to maps when configuring a preset the second is a style called openlayers map that can be applied to pages blocks attachments and so on and give users an easy

another node access module this module allows you to manage permissions for content types by role it allows you to specifiy custom view view own edit edit own delete and delete own permissions for each content type optionally you can enable per content access settings so you can customize the access for each content node in particular it comes with sensible defaults so you need not configure anything and everything stays working it is as flexible as you want it can work with per content type settings per content node settings as well as with flexible access control lists with the help of the acl module it trys to reuse existing functionality instead of reimplementing it so one can install the acl module and set per user access control settings per content node furthermore the module provides conditions and actions for the rules module which allows one to configure even rulebased access permissions it optimizes the written content node grants so that only the really necessary grants are written this is important for the performance of your site it takes access control as important as it is eg the module has a bunch of simpletests to ensure everything is working right it respects and makes use of drupal s built in permissions as far as possible which means the access control tab provided by this module takes them into account and provides you a good overview about the really applied access control settings 1 so the module is simple to use but can be configured to provide really finegrained permissions installation copy the content access module s directory to your modules directory and activate the module optionally download and install the acl module too edit a content type at admin content types there will be a new tab access control acl module you can find

content node you are able to grant view edit or delete permission for specific users running multiple node access modules on a site advanced a drupal node access module can only grant access to content nodes but not deny it so if you are using multiple node access modules access will be granted to a node as soon as one of the module grants access to it however you can influence the behaviour by changing the priority of the content access module as drupal applies only the grants with the highest priority so if content access has the highest priority alone only its grants will be applied by default node access modules use priority 0 footnotes 1 note that this overview can t take other modules into account which might also alter node access if you have multiple modules installed that

',0),(218,'help',' readme description this module gets around two quirks in the 6x core node module currently the node module causes access grants to be ignored for unpublished content ors together access grants coming from multiple modules this results in content being made accessible by one module when access had already been restricted by another which is undesirable in most cases the module ensures that access grants are tested for unpublished content just as they are for published content so that using the workflow module or any other module that uses the nodeaccess table you can implement workflows that deal effectively with content moving from author via moderator to publisher before it is published which is where it s needed most once content is visible for all to see it s a bit late to start a publication workflow process using taxonomy access control or lite you can restrict access to content to userdefined vocabularies such as departments or regions with module grants this will work for unpublished content just as it does for published content moreover when workflow and tac or taclite are used together this module makes sure that the combination exhibits the expected behaviour access is granted to content only when it is in the correct state and of the appropriate vocabulary term such as department country etc the modulegrants module achieves this by anding rather than oring the grants module grants comes bundled with module grants monitor optional which provides users with a new menu item accessible content that shows a list of all content accessible to the loggedin user based on the permissions and access grants as determined by enabled modules this list may be filtered using a double row of tabs residing at the top of the page see point 3a below installation and configuration 1 place the modulegrants folder in your sites all modules directory 2 under administer site building modules enable module grants and optionally module grants monitor recommended 3a visit administer user management permissions make sure that roles that are meant to be able to view unpublished and not yet published content have one of the following permissions o view revisions section node module or o view any all content section revisioning module if revisioning installed make sure that the role of anonymous user does not have any of the above permissions 3b there s usually no need to tick administer nodes for any role which is good because administer nodes equates to almost godlike powers that you wouldn t normally give to normal users 4 if required install and enable as many modules for content access control as you need for your situation typical examples are taxonomy access control or use tac lite and workflow 5 optional but highly recommended especially when using revisioning under administer user management permissions section modulegrantsmonitor module select for each role which filtering tab they will get to use the permissions which are in alphabetical rahter than logical order relate to two rows of tabs that appear on the accessible content page the first row of up to 4 tabs filter content the loggedin user created modified can edit can view the second row of up to 3 tabs further filter content according to it being published unpublished includes previously published as well as not yet published either all that is no additional filtering note 1 you must tick at least one permission box for each of the 2 rows note 2 these tick boxes only determine whether the role in question gets to see the tabs they do not in any way affect access to content so in that sense you can safely tick any or all of the tab boxes for all authenticated users however you may not want to confuse certain roles with too many tabs and too much output usage module grants monitor creates a new navigation menu item accessible content visible to the administrator and to roles to which the administrator granted access as per the above section point 5 the content shown under accessible content reflects the access grants given by modules installed on your system to the current user you can use module grants in combination with tac or taclite for finegrained access control based on vocabularies such as department assigned to the various content types you can then create departmentspecific roles eg sports author music author and enforce that these roles can only access content belonging to their departments whether it s published or not create your grants schemes on this page administer user management access control by taxonmy in addition you may want to install the workflow module to further segragate roles eg author and moderator via access control based on states such as in draft in review and published see administer site building workflow the module makes sure that access to content is given only when both the tac lite and the workflow access modules grant it as opposed to one or the other this module also works well with the revisioning module for creating effective publication workflows operating on published as well as unpublished content revisions see the revisioning project page at http drupalorg project revisioning for three stepbystep tutorials be aware that any permissions given in the node module section override the access grants given by the workflow and taclite modules so you probably only want to assign a few creation permissions in the node module and grant view update and delete via tac taclite and or workflow additional configuration options are found at

get post requests are not cacheable and are passed through to drupal 2 since only anonymous visitors can benefit from the static page cache at present we check that the page request doesn t include a cookie that is set when a user logs in to the drupal site if the cookie is present we simply let drupal handle the page request dynamically 3 now for the important bit we check whether we actually have a cached html file for the request url path available in the file system cache if we do we direct the web server to serve that file directly and to terminate the request immediately after in this case drupal and indeed php is never invoked meaning the page request will be served by the web server itself at full speed 4 if however we couldn t locate a cached version of the page we just pass the request on to drupal which will serve it dynamically in the normal manner back to top limitations only anonymous visitors will be served cached versions of pages authenticated users will get dynamic

research early in 1989 under the direction of the board of regents an adhoc planning panel was convened to explore the proper role for nlm in the rapidly changing field of electronic imaging after much deliberation the nlm planning panel on electronic image libraries made the following recommendation nlm should undertake a first project building a digital image library of volumetric data representing a complete normal adult male and female this visible human project will include digitized photographic images for cryosectioning digital images derived from computerized tomography and

features elysia cron extends drupal standard cron allowing a fine grain control over each task and several ways to add custom cron jobs to your site set the timings and frequencies of each cron task you can run some jobs every day at a specified hour other only monthly and so on for each task you can simply choose between some frequently used options once a day once a month or use a powerful linux crontab like syntax to set the accurate timings you can even define your frequently used options to speed up site configuration parallel execution of cron task you can group jobs in channels and execute then simultaneously so a task that takes a lot of time to execute won t block other tasks that need to be executed every 5 minutes you can disable all tasks an entire channel or a single task change the priority order of task execution manual force the execution of a cron tasks detailed overview of cron status with time statistics for single tasks and channels powerful api for module developers you can define extra cron tasks for your modules each one with own default timings site administrators can override them by configuration other modules via hookalter elysia cron 20 gives a brand new api support compatible with 10 version with a lot of features administrators can define custom jobs call to functions with parameters via the script option several optimization for frequent cron calls and error handling protection from external cron calling by cronkey or allowed host list elysia has no dependencies with contributed modules and doesn t need to patch the core it can be used in minimal drupal installation with only core modules it also can be used in a drupal install profile 3rd party integration ping feature for external tracking services like hosttracker to tell whether cron is functioning properly on your site drush support you can call drush elysiacron to manually run extended cron ctools support for exports backup of task settings features support usage examples elysia cron is usually used in large sites that needs performance optimization avoid drupal peak loads by distributing heavy load tasks during quiet periods of the day for example you may want to rebuild the xml sitemap of your site at 200am in the morning where usually only a few people are visiting your site you can even move some tasks to be executed only once a month log rotation old records expiry if you have tasks that should be executed very often but don t want to execute all drupal cron tasks that often for example you may want to check for emails that needs to be sent to your users every 2 minutes standard cron is managed in a monolithic way so even if you find out how to execute it every 2 minutes you will end in having all cron tasks executed so often with a lot of performance problems fine tune cron cache management drupal cron will invalidate variable cache every cron run and this is a great performance problem if you have a frequently called task elysia cron optimize cache management and doesn t need to invalidate cache setup tasks that should be run at a precise time for example if you want to send a simplenews newsletter every monday at 900am you can do it parallel execution if you have a task that takes a lot of time to execute you can setup a different channel for it so it won t block other tasks that need to be executed every 5 minutes turn off disable a cron task feature you don t need debug system cron problems if your cron does not terminate correctly you can use extended logging see at each cron timings and disable task to track down the problem channels channels are groups of tasks each channel is a parallel line of execution multiple channels can be executed simultaneously tasks inside a channel will be executed sequentially if they should warning it s not recommended to create more than 2 or 3 channels every channel will increase the delay between each cron check of the same channel because each cron call will cycle between all channels so for example if you have 1 channel it will be checked once a minute if you have 2 channel each one will be checked every 2 minutes almost usually when the other one is running it will be checked once a minute it you have 10 channels there will be a check every 10 minutes if you have a job that should be executed every 5 minutes it won t do so export via ctools features module with 20 version of elysia cron you can use bulk export functionality of chaos tools suite to export cron settings to use it simply enable all modules go to structure bulk exporter and select the tasks you want to export settings you can also select all elysiacron prefixed variables to export global options than generate the module the generated code will set the new defaults of elysia cron settings this way you can simply enable it to use them but you are free to override them in the future using the normal settings page note that if you want to delete all overrides and return to exported settings you should do a reset to defaults from elysia cron settings page you can also use features module to create a feature module will the settings you need note that if you want to delete the overridden settings it s preferable to use the reset to defaults elysia cron s button you can use the revert components features s button but this will reset also all cron statistics if you are not interested in them you can freely use that button drush support elysia cron 20 adds a simple support for drush module you can execute the elysiacron command to run cron rules and script syntax 1

match the current time and date there is one exception if both day of month and day of week are restricted not then either the day of month field 3 or the day of week field 5 must match the current day even though the other of the two fields need not match the current day 2 fields operator there are several ways of specifying multiple date time values in a field the comma operator specifies a list of values for example 13478 the dash operator specifies a range of values for example 16 which is equivalent to 123456 the asterisk operator specifies all possible values for a field for example an asterisk in the hour time field would be equivalent to every hour subject to matching other specified fields the slash operator called step can be used to skip a given number of values for example 3 in the hour time field is equivalent to 036912151821 3 examples 15 execute job every 15 minutes 0 214 execute job every day at 200 and 1400 0 2 15 execute job at 200 of every working day 0 12 1 2 1

user tool but a developer and site builder tool which provides an api and a limited ui an example of such a variable is sitefrontpage in drupal this defaults to node which ensures that the front page gets content as soon as some exists but for many drupal sites this setting is simply wrong strongarm gives the site builder a place in the equation an opportunity to set the default value of sitefrontpage to something that makes sense for their site installation strongarm can be installed like any other drupal module place it in the modules directory for your site and enable it and its requirement ctools on the admin build modules page strongarm is an api module it does absolutely nothing for the end user out of the box without other modules that take advantage of its api how strongarm works strongarm uses the ctools export api to make entries in the system module s variable table exportables exportables are drupal configuration objects that lead a dual life they may be defaults set by code exports in modules they may be overridden if a user chooses to change the value in the database or they may be normal if the configuration object lives only in the database but not in code to learn more about exportables and the ctools export api see the ctools advanced help on exportable objects tool exporting variables if you are a developer or site builder strongarm gives you tools to export the settings of variables in your site database and manage any overrides to default values to export variable values you will need to enable either the features 1 module or the

will be a new content type profile customize its settings at admin content types at the bottom of each content type edit form there is a checkbox which allows you to mark a content type as profile when you edit a profile content type there will be a further tab content profile which provides content profile specific settings warning the module uses drupal s content or nodes for user profiles so the access permissions applied to view the content profiles are the regular node related permissions that means the access user profiles permission of the user module still applies only to the user account pages at user uid but not to content profiles which can be viewed at node nid too still you can use any regular node access module to restrict access to your content profiles eg you may use the content access module for that http drupalorg project contentaccess content profiles per role you may but you need not mark multiple content types as profile by customizing the permissions of a content type this allows you to create different profiles for different roles hints when using content profiles the title field is sometimes annoying you can rename it at the content types settings or hide it in the form and auto generate a title by using the auto nodetitle module http drupalorg project autonodetitle if you want to link to a content profile of a user you can always link to the path user uid profile type where uid is the users id and type the machine readable content type name an example path would be user 1 profile profile this path is working regardless the user has already profile content created or not if you want to theme your content profile you can do it like with any other content read http drupalorg node 266817 if you want a content profile to be private while your site content should be available to the public you need a module that allows configuring more fine grained access control permissions eg the module content access http drupalorg project contentaccess allows you to that there is also rules integration which is useful for customizing the behaviour of the module see below for more theming easily use profile information in your templates content profile adds a new variable contentprofile to most templates related to users so this variable allows easy access to the data contained in the users profiles furthermore it does its job fast by lazyloading and caching the needed content profile nodes the contentprofile variable is available in the page node comment username userprofile usersignature searchresult and some other templates

this property to your flash object s see http drupalorg node 195386 for further information faq q when the administration menu module is enabled blank space is added to the bottom of my theme why a this is caused by a long list of links to module issue queues at drupalorg use administer user management permissions to disable the display drupal links permission for all appropriate roles note that since uid 1 automatically receives all permissions the list of issue queue links cannot be disabled for uid 1 q after upgrading to 6x1x the menu disappeared why a you may need to regenerate your menu visit http examplecom admin build modules to regenerate your menu substitute your site name for examplecom q can i configure the administration menu module to display another menu like the navigation menu for instance a no as the name implies administration menu module is for administrative menu links only however you can copy and paste the contents of adminmenucss into your theme s stylesheet and replace adminmenu with any other menu block id blockmenu1 for example q sometimes the user counter displays a lot of anonymous users but no spike of users or requests appear in google analytics or other tracking tools a if your site was concurrently spidered by searchengine robots it may have a significant number of anonymous users for a short time most web tracking tools like google analytics automatically filter out these requests q i enabled aggregate and compress css files but adminmenucss is still there is this normal a yes this is the intended behavior the administration menu module only loads its stylesheet as needed ie on page requests by loggedon administrative users q why are submenus not visible in opera a in the opera browser preferences under web pages there is an option to fit to width by disabling this option submenus in the administration menu should appear q how can the administration menu be hidden on certain pages a you can suppress it by simply calling the following function in php moduleinvoke adminmenu suppress however this needs to happen as early as possible in the page request so placing it in the theming layer resp a page template file is too late ideally the function is called in hookinit in a custom module if you do not have a custom module placing it into some conditional code at the top of templatephp may work out too contact current

using advanced help the advanced help system is a pluggable system that provides advanced help facilities for drupal and its modules although the advanced help does not provide general help by itself it provides a powerful and easy framework that modules may use to provide their own help modules utilizing advanced help should create a help subdirectory inside their module s directory place the file modulenamehelpini in this subdirectory formatted similar to the following example buses title how buses are tied into the system file buses topicid title title of topic file filename of topic without the html extension weight how important the topic is on the index page parent the optional topic parent to use in the breadcrumb either topic or module topic all topics are addressed by the module providing the topic and by the topic id to embed links use the following format output theme advancedhelptopic module topic inside your help file link to other topics using the format  a href topic module topic   this format will ensure the popup status remains consistent when switching between links use  a href path examplejpg  to reference items within the help directory such as images you wish to embed within the help text use  a href baseurl admin settings siteconfiguration  to reference any normal path in the site if the search module is enabled the contents of help system will be indexed on cron if you enable new modules and wish to immediately index its help text visit the administration reports status report and click the run cron manually link example  don t click this

use a more friendly name than appears in the info file index name this may be set to change the name of the module in the module index it overrides the name setting above as well as the module name in its info file hide this may be used to hide a module in the module index this is particularly useful for modules who insert their help files into the hierarchy of another module as might be done by modules that extend views or cck by setting hide true the module will not appear as its own entry each section after that will correspond to a single help file and each one may have the following

the same weight are sorted alphabetically parent the topic id to use in a hierarchy children will be listed beneath parents in the topic list and will have the parent in their breadcrumb trail you may parent this topic to another module s topic by using module topic as the identifier for example views display will make this a child of the display topic in the views module line break if set to true linebreaks will be converted into br and p tags automatically if unspecified will default to off set to 0 to disable the filter if this has been turned on in the global settings css specify a css file

help system was designed to replace the original drupal help system which has several flaws that make it hard to create new help hard to maintain existing help and particularly hard to access help the primary goal then is to increase the accessibility of help meaning the ability of both the user and the help text author to access the needed tools to use create maintain and translate the help this system is completely separate from drupal s hookhelp in drupal 6 it actually coexists with it in the future it is hoped that it will completely replace it allowing hookhelp to be deprecated and removed messages added to the top of a page are not really help often these messages are an introduction to a form or a short blurb telling a user what to do with a particular page the problem is these messages are always there they are easily ignored and they come before the actual page in general when users are learning they want to see the page first then ask questions the reverse order is much less conducive to actually teaching a user how to use something by allowing help to be available on request the system conforms more naturally to how most people work advanced help is organized by topic with the hookhelp method help text is organized by url path this is fine if you have help text describing how to use a particular page or what a particular page does but ultimately is limiting because manuals and documentation are usually grouped by topic and those topics are determined by the material itself advanced help allows the documentation author to organize topics as he or she sees fit the only restriction really is that each individual chunk of text needs to stand on its own as a discrete topic what s more modules can insert their topics into another module s hierarchy this would allow the drupal core to create a task based help navigation system which allows modules insert topics into that navigation fluidly this allows modules to continue to keep their systems separate yet integrate into the main system advanced help topics are processed html in their own files this separation makes it easy to find and modify currently everything is lumped together in hookhelp in php strings that are run through t and there is a fair amount of php code necessary in this system that actually gets in the way of writing good explanatory text in fact requiring a documentation author to understand php at all is a detriment the idea that documentation writers need to have php development as a skill seriously reduces the number of available contributors html on the other hand is a much more common skill is relatively easy to learn and the amount of html needed to write documentation is only a little bit more than the html used in forum posts another benefit to not using php is that the files themselves are safe they are unlikely to include malicious php code that could take over the server or do worse things this means that these files can be used relatively easily on the drupalorg hardware so that a module s help files can be made immediately available without needing to download the module it also means that descriptions of the module can be made on drupalorg that are version aware can be corrected easily in cvs with patches but can also be made available with the module so that drupalorg is not required this also means that we could if we wanted package the drupalorg handbooks or a subset of them directly into a drupal distribution or a drupal addon so that drupal administrators can have drupal help without needing to visit drupalorg this can be valuable in locked down corporate environments and on planes but more importantly the handbooks can be made version aware much more easily than the current method on drupalorg the downside to this method is that these books can t easily be made dynamic though the use of alter hooks could allow a module to make modifications to the help as needed doing this could make the help files less useful when you take them out of context advanced help files are translated as a file it is actually not easy to translate documents as strings particularly when the language being used is very much unlike english in fact when translating a document the organization of the sentences may change drastically it is also a burden on the cpu to do this as you are indexing on very long strings translators have a much better time translating a document as a unit because of the presence of the entire context advanced help has its own navigation system by making use of a navigation system specified in a ini file which is not php code and therefore safe to use on drupalorg sites the help can be structured like a book which is typical of online manuals this is familiar to users can be organized and reorganized and allows a module to include significantly richer text without burdening the php code with having its help loaded unnecessarily this book can be navigated hierarchically as well making it easy to keep related topics together advanced help is indexed by the search engine an important goal of this system was to add searchability to the help by being able to enter keywords into the search box and find relevant topics we come up with a system that resembles the kind of help that comes with many operating systems this is very valuable when searching through manuals trying to find out how to do a particular thing this search is specific to the help meaning that the help will not be mixed in with the global node search this can be considered both an advantage and a disadvantage for the most part this help system is meant to provide help to site administrators and content searches should not find it the disadvantage of course is when you want to use it for end user help you will not be able to inline help can be brought in via popups in addition to the manuallike hierarchical navigation advanced help can also provide contextsensitive additional help through a popup while popups are controversial the argument for using them is that when getting help while on a form  a popup will not throw away a user s data browsers are not very friendly to input forms if they are not submitted and navigating away from the form can be dangerous there are various other solutions to this problem but each one has a drawback the drawbacks to popups are well known but mostly it is the irritation of having new windows when getting help though a popup is usually invited help should not interfere with what the operation the user is trying to complete it differs greatly from the uninvited popup which are usually ads or popups meant to prevent users from navigating away from a site these popups can be added to a page with text links or icon links  ',0),(168,'help',' readme this module integrates drupal with the apache solr search platform solr search can be used as a replacement for core content search and boasts both extra features and

this filter isn t already displayed as a checkbox radio button if this is a cckbased field field title starts with content make sure you re filtering on the allowed values option you re using views 3x the bef settings have been moved to the exposed form dialog wow a really long url is generated when using exposed filters how can i make it a more reasonable length exposed views filters with or without bef enabled store their current selection in the url query string this allows for easy bookmarking of search results as well as return to search results links however it can make for long urls when using views default settings especially with cckbased fields to shorten the key used for a given filter configure the filter and change the value in the filter indentifier textbox make sure that your indentifiers are unique within your view faq q what was the motivation to build this module a i find multiselect boxes to be a horrible user experience imagine telling a a client that they should click on an option then scroll to the next option and ctrl click on it make sure not to just click as you ll lose your first selection and ctrl click again to unselect an option yeah not user friendly q can t you just use hookformalter to flip the exposed filter type from select to checkboxes a yes that will get you checkboxes displayed but they won t act as you would expect for example leaving all checkboxes unchecked often the default state returns zero results q so how does better exposed filters work a bef changes the display of an exposed filter at the theme level this also allows a designer to customize the display by overriding bef s themeselectascheckboxes q what is the hidden option used for a you can use the hidden option to build multipage search for example on the first page the user selects a country on the next page they select a region etc to build this using bef create a view with only the country field as an exposed filter on the second page expose filters for both the region and country fields but set the display of the country filter to hidden more details can be found here http drupalorg node 645348 comment2336516 contact the maintainer for this project

inc file and the functionaly they offer can differ wildly context context is the idea that the objects that are used in page generation have more value than simply creating a single piece of output instead contexts can be used to create multiple pieces of content that can all be put onto the page additionally contexts can be used to derive other contexts via relationships such as determining the node author and displaying data about the new context ajax tools ajax also known as ahah is a method of allowing the browser and the server to communicate without requiring a page refresh it can be used to create complicated interactive forms but it is somewhat difficult to integrate into drupal s form api these tools make it easier to accomplish this goal in addition ctools provides a few other javascript helpers such as a modal dialog a collapsible div a simple dropdown and dependent checkboxes css scrubbing and caching drupal comes with a fantastic array of tools to ensure html is safe to output but does not contain any similar tools for css ctools provides a small tool to sanitize css so that userinput css code can still be safely used it also provides a method for caching css for better performance exportable objects views and panels both use objects that can either be in code or in the database and the object can be exported into a piece of php code so that it can be moved from site to site or out of the database entirely this library abstracts that so that other modules can use this same concept for their data form tools drupal 6 s fapi really improved over drupal 5

job of dealing with data in between forms temporary object cache for normal forms all of the data needed for an object is stored in the form so that the browser handles a lot of the work for multistep and ajax forms however this is impractical and letting the browser store data can be insecure the object cache provides a nonvolatile location to store temporary data while the form is being worked on this is much safer than the standard drupal caching mechanism which is volatile meaning it can be cleared at any time and any system using it must be capable of recreating the data that was there this

easy to update when you make api changes you can then use the usual moduleinvoke type commands mymoduleincludeapi moduleinvoke myhook data if you need to pass references this construct is standard foreach mymoduleincludeapi as module info function module hookname just because they implement the api and include a file does not guarantee they implemented a hook function if functionexists function continue typically arraymerge is used below if data is returned result function data1 data2 data3 todo there needs to be a way to check api version without including anything as a module may simply provide normal plugins and versioning could still matter  ',0),(40,'help',' creating plugins there are two primary pieces to using plugins the first is getting the data and the second is using the data getting the data to create a plugin a module only has to execute ctoolsgetplugins with the right data ctoolsinclude plugins ctoolsgetplugins module type id in the above example module should be your module s name and type is the type of the plugin it is typically best practice to provide some kind of wrapper function to make this easier for example panels provides the following functions to implement the contenttypes plugin fetch metadata on a specific contenttype plugin param content type name of a panel content type return an array with information about the requested panel content type function panelsgetcontenttype contenttype ctoolsinclude context ctoolsinclude plugins return ctoolsgetplugins panels contenttypes contenttype fetch metadata for all contenttype plugins return an array of arrays with information about all available panel content types function panelsgetcontenttypes ctoolsinclude context ctoolsinclude plugins return ctoolsgetplugins panels contenttypes as a plugin creator your module can also implement a hook to give more information about this plugin and to enable a few features that are not normally enabled if you need any of these features simply implement hookctoolsplugintype where type is the same type sent to ctoolsgetplugins this isn t a true hook it will only be called for the module that was given this hook returns an array inform ctools that the layout plugin can be loaded from themes function panelsctoolspluginlayouts return array load themes true the following information can be specified cache defaults to  false if set to true the results of ctoolsgetplugins will be cached in the cache table by default thus preventing inc files from being loaded ctoolsgetplugins looking for a specific plugin will always load the appropriate inc file cache table defaults to   cache  if cache is true then this value specifies the cache table where the cached plugin information will be stored defaults defaults to  array  an array of defaults that should be added to each plugin this can be used to ensure that every plugin has the basic data necessary these defaults will not ovewrite data supplied by the plugin this could also be a function name in which case the callback will be used to provide defaults note however that the callbackbased approach is deprecated as it is redundant with the process callback and as such will be removed in later versions consequently you should only use the array form for maximum crossversion compatibility load themes defaults to  false if set to true then plugins of this type can be supplied by themes as well as modules if this is the case all themes that are currently enabled will provide a plugin note due to a slight ui bug in drupal it is possible for the default theme to be active but not enabled if this is the case that theme will not provide plugins so if you are using this feature be sure to document that issue also themes set via customtheme do not necessarily need to be enabled but the system has no way of knowing what those themes are so the enabled flag is the only true method of identifying which themes can provide layouts hook defaults to   dynamic value the name of the hook used to collect data for this plugin normally this is  module type  but this can be changed here if you change this you must be sure to document this for your plugin implementors as it will change the format of the specially named hook process defaults to    an optional function callback to use for processing a plugin this can be used to provide automated settings that must be calculated perplugin instance ie it is not enough to simply append an array via defaults the parameters on this callback are  callback plugin info  where plugin is a reference to the plugin as processed and info is the fully processed result of hookctoolspluginapiinfo extension defaults to   inc  can be used to change the extension on files containing plugins of this type by default the extension will be inc though it will default to info if info files is set to true do not include the dot in the extension if changing it that will be added automatically info file defaults to  false if set to true then the plugin will look for a info file instead of a inc internally this will look exactly the same though obviously a info file cannot contain functions this can be good for styles that may not need to contain code use hooks defaults to  true  use to enable support for plugin definition hooks instead of plugin definition files note using a central plugin definition hook is less optimal for the plugins system and as such this will default to false in later versions child plugins defaults to  false if set to true the plugin type can automatically have child plugins meaning each plugin can actually provide multiple plugins this is mostly used for plugins that store some of their information in the database such as views blocks or exportable custom versions of plugins to implement each plugin can have a get child and get children callback both of these should be implemented for performance reasons since it is best to avoid getting all children if necessary but if get child is not implemented it will fall back to get children if it has to child plugins should be named parent child with the being the separator so that it knows which parent plugin to ask for teh child the get children method should at least return the parent plugin as part of the list unless it wants the parent plugin itself to not be a choosable option which is not unheard of get children arguments are plugin parent and get child arguments are plugin parent child in addition there is a module and type settings these are for internal use of the plugin system and you should not change these using the data each plugin returns a packet of data which is added to with a few defaults each plugin is guaranteed to always have the following data name the name of the plugin this is also the key in the array of the full list of plugins and is placed here since that is not always available module the module that supplied the plugin file the actual file containing the plugin path the path to the file containing the plugin this is useful for using secondary files such as templates css files images etc that may come with a plugin any of the above items can be overridden by the plugin itself though the most likely one to be modified is the path the most likely data beyond simple printable data for a plugin to provide is a callback the plugin system provides a pair of functions to make it easy and consistent for these callbacks to be used the first is ctoolsplugingetfunction which requires the full plugin object get a function from a plugin if it exists if the plugin is not already loaded try ctoolspluginloadfunction instead param plugin the loaded plugin type param callbackname the identifier of the function for example settings form return the actual name of the function to call or null if the function does not exist function ctoolsplugingetfunction plugin callbackname the second does not require the full plugin object and will load it load a plugin and get a function name from it returning success only if the function exists param module the module that owns the plugin type param type the type of plugin param id the id of the specific plugin to load param callbackname the identifier of the function for example settings form return the actual name of the function to call or null if the function does not exist function ctoolspluginloadfunction module type id callbackname both of these functions will ensure any needed files are included in fact it allows each callback to specify alternative include files the plugin implementation could include code like this callbackname actualnameoffunctionhere or like this callbackname array file filename path filepath optional will use plugin path if absent function actualnameoffunctionhere an example for pluginexample type plugin array name myplugin module mymodule examplecallback array file mypluginextrafileinc function mymodulemypluginexamplecallback to utilize this callback on this plugin if function ctoolsplugingetfunction plugin examplecallback function arg1 arg2 etc  document your plugins  since the data provided by your plugin tends to be specific to your plugin type you really need to document what the data returned in the hook in the inc file will be or nobody will figure it out use advanced help and document it there if every system that utilizes plugins does this then plugin implementors will quickly learn to expect the documentation to be in the advanced help  ',0),(41,'help',' implementing plugins to implement plugins you need to implement a single hook in your module to tell the system where your plugins live and then you need to implement one or more inc files that contain the plugin data telling it where your plugins live to implement any plugins at all you must implement a single function for all plugins  hookctoolsplugindirectory  every time a module loads plugins this hook will be called to see which modules implement those plugins and in what directory those plugins will live function hookctoolsplugindirectory module plugin if module panels plugin contenttypes return plugins contenttypes the directory returned should be relative to your module another common usage is to simply return that you implement all plugins owned by a given module or modules function hookctoolsplugindirectory module plugin if module panels return plugins plugin typically it is recommended that all plugins be placed into the plugins directory for clarity and maintainability inside the directory any number of subdirectories can be used for plugins that require extra files such as templates css javascript or image files this is highly recommended mymodulemodule mymoduleinfo plugins contenttypes mycontenttypeinc layouts mylayoutinc mylaoutcss mylayouttplphp mylayoutimagepng how a theme can implement plugins themes can implement plugins if the plugin owner specified that it s possible in its hookctoolsapitype call if so it is generally exactly the same as modules except for one important difference themes don t get hookctoolsplugindirectory instead themes add a line to their info file plugins module type directory how to structure the inc file the top of the inc file should contain an array that defines the plugin this array is simply defined in the global namespace of the file and does not need a function note that previous versions of this plugin system required a specially named function while this function will still work its use is now discouraged as it is annoying to name properly this array should look something like this plugin array key value several values will be filled in for you automatically but you can override them if necessary they include name path file and module additionally the plugin can owner can provide other defaults as well after this array if your plugin needs functions they can be declared different plugin types have different needs here so exactly what else will be needed will change from type to type  ',0),(42,'help',' exportable objects tool exportable objects are objects that can live either in the database or in code or in both if they live in both then the object in code is considered to be overridden meaning that the version in code is ignored in favor of the version in the database the main benefit to this is that you can move objects that are intended to be structure or featurerelated into code thus removing them entirely from the database this is a very important part of the deployment path since in an ideal world the database is primarily user generated content whereas site structure and site features should be in code however many many features in drupal rely on objects being in the database and provide uis to create them using this system you can give your objects dual life they can be created in the ui exported into code and put in revision control views and panels both use this system heavily plus any object that properly implements this system can be utilized by the features module to be used as part of a bundle of objects that can be turned into feature modules typically exportable objects have two identifiers one identifier is a simple serial used for database identification it is a primary key in the database and can be used locally it also has a name which is an easy way to uniquely identify it this makes it much less likely that importing and exporting these objects across systems will have collisions they still can of course but with good name selection these problems can be worked around making your objects exportable to make your objects exportable you do have to do a medium amount of work create a chunk of code in your object s schema definition in the install file to introduce the object to ctools export system create a load function for your object that utilizes ctoolsexportloadobject create a save function for your object that utilizes drupalwriterecord or any method you desire create an import and export mechanism from the ui the export section of the schema file exportable objects are created by adding definition to the schema in an export section for example function mymoduleschema schema mymodulemyobj array description t table storing myobj definitions export array key name key name name primary key oid identifier myobj exports will be as myobj default hook defaultmymodulemyobj function hook name api array owner mymodule api defaultmymodulemyobjs base name for api include files minimumversion 1 currentversion 1 if the key is stored in a table that is joined in specify it key in table myjointable if your object s data is split up across multiple tables you can specify additional tables to join this is very useful when working with modules like exportablesmodule that has a special table for translating keys to local database ids the joined table must have its own schema definition if using joins you should implement a delete callback see below to ensure that deletes happen properly exportinc does not do this automatically join array exportables array the following parameters will be used in this way select from mymodulemyobj t0 inner join myjointable t1 on t0id t1id and extras table myjointable leftkey format rightkey id optionally you can define extra clauses to add to the inner join extras and extraclauses you must specify which fields will be loaded these fields must exist in the schema definition of the joined table load array machine and finally you can define other tables to perform inner joins otherjoins array table fields array name array type varchar length 255 description unique id for this object used to identify it programmatically oid array type serial unsigned true not null true description primary id field for the table not used for anything except internal lookups no export true do not export databaseonly keys primary key array oid unique keys array name array name return schema key this is the primary key of the exportable object and should be a string as names are more portable across systems it is possible to use numbers here but be aware that export collisions are very likely defaults to name key name human readable title of the export key defaults to name because the schema is cached do not translate this it must instead be translated when used primary key objects should contain a primary key which is a database identifier primarily used to determine if an object has been written or not this is required for the default crud save callback to work object the class the object should be created as defaults as stdclass can disable control whether or not the exportable objects can be disabled all this does is cause the disabled field on the object to always be set appropriately and a variable is kept to record the state changes made to this state must be handled by the owner of the object defaults to true status exportable objects can be enabled or disabled and this status is stored in a variable this defines what variable that is defaults to default table default hook what hook to invoke to find exportable objects that are currently defined these will all be gathered into a giant array defaults to default

be an identifier of the export key load all callback crud callback to use to load all items usually for administrative purposes if not provided the default load function will be used the callback will

will be used the callback will accept a single argument which can be either the object or just the export key to delete the callback must be able to accept either export callback crud callback to use for exporting if not provided the default export function will be used the callback will accept two arguments the first is the item to export the second is the indent to place on the export if any import callback crud callback to use for importing if not provided the default export function will be used this function will accept the code as a single argument and if the code evaluates return an object represented by that code in the case of failure this will return a string with human readable errors in addition each field can contain the following no export set to true to prevent that field from being exported export callback a function to override the export behavior it will receive myobject field value indent as arguments by default fields are exported through ctoolsvarexport  reserved

name will invoke your load callback and calling ctoolsexportcrudloadall table reset will invoke your load all callback the default handlers should be sufficient for most uses typically there will be two load functions a single load to load just one object and an all load to load all of the objects for use in administrating the objects or utilizing the objects when you need all of them using

ctools form tool is a replacement for drupalgetform that includes some additional functionality it takes formstate as an argument which is accepted as a reference meaning when the form is complete you can examine the formstate to see what the form did it can handle get as an input source or the input can be provided from some other source it can be told not to render or not to redirect which can be important during ajax operations it can provide a special wrapper form which is used by the wizard tool to provide a standard set of buttons to a form usage ctoolsinclude form output ctoolsbuildform formid formstate previously arguments to the form builder were passed into drupalgetform this is no longer true you have two options for passing arguments to the form with ctoolsbuildform set

multistep forms are a process by which the user goes through or can use an arbitrary number of different forms to create a single object or perform a single task traditionally the multistep form is difficult in drupal because there is no easy place to put data in between forms no longer the form wizard tool allows a single entry point to easily set up a wizard of multiple forms provide callbacks to handle data storage and updates between forms and when forms are completed this tool pairs well with the object cache tool for storage the form info array the wizard starts with an array of data that describes all of the forms available to the wizard and sets options for how the wizard will present and control the flow here is an example of the forminfo array as used in the delegator module forminfo array id delegatorpage path admin build pages edit pagename step show trail true show back true show return false next callback delegatorpageaddsubtasknext finish callback

delegatorpageformmenu argument array form id delegatorpageformargument multiple array form id delegatorpageargumentformmultiple the above array starts with an id which is used to identify the wizard in various places and a path which is needed to redirect to the next step between forms it then creates some settings which control which pieces are displayed in this case it displays a form trail and a back button but not the return button then there are the wizard callbacks which allow the wizard to act appropriately when forms are submitted finally it contains a list of forms and their order so that it knows which forms to use and what order to use them by default note that the keys in the order and list of forms match that key is called the step and is used to identify each individual step of the wizard here is a full list of every item that can be in the form info array id an id for wizard this is used like a hook to automatically name callbacks  as well as a form step s form building function it is also used in trail theming path the path to use when redirecting between forms  step will be replaced with the key for the form return path when a form is complete this is the path to go to this is required if the return button is shown and not using ajax it is also used for the finish button if it is not present and needed the cancel path will also be checked cancel path when a form is canceled this is the path to go to this is required if the cancel is shown and not using ajax show trail if set to true the form trail will be shown like a breadcrumb at the top of each form

using ctools ajaxinc defaults to false modal put the wizard in the modal tool the modal must already be open and called from an ajax button for this to work which is easily accomplished using functions provided by the modal tool ajax render a callback to display the rendered form via ajax this is not required if using the modal tool but is required otherwise since ajax by itself does not know how to render the results params formstate output finish callback the function to call when a form is complete and the finish button has been clicked this function should finalize all data params

cache it for later use by the finish callback params formstate defaults to forminfo id next if function exists order an optional array of forms keyed by the step which represents the default order the forms will be displayed in if not set the forms array will control the order note that submit callbacks can override the order so that branching logic can be used forms an array of form info arrays keyed by step describing every form available to the wizard if order array isn t set the wizard will use this to set the default order each array contains form id the id of the form as used in the drupal form system this is also the name of the function that represents the form builder defaults to forminfo id stepform include the name of a file to include which contains the code for this form this makes it easy to include the form wizard in another file or set of files this must be the full path of the file so be sure to use drupalgetpath when setting this this can also be an array of files if multiple files need to be included title the title of the form to be optionally set via drupalgettitle this is required when using the modal if formstate title is not set invoking the form wizard your module should create a page callback via hookmenu and this callback should contain an argument for the step the path that leads to this page callback should be the same as the path set in the forminfo array the page callback should set up the forminfo and figure out what the default step should be if no step is provided note that the wizard does not do this for you you must specify a step then invoke the form wizard formstate array ctoolsinclude wizard output ctoolswizardmultistepform forminfo step formstate if using ajax or the modal this part is actually done if not you have one more small step return output  forms and their callbacks each form within the wizard is a complete independent form using drupal s form api system it has a form builder callback as well as submit and validate callbacks and can be form altered the primary difference between these forms and a normal drupal form is that the submit handler should not save any data instead it should make any changes to a cached object usually placed on the formstate and only the finish or return handler should actually save any real data how you handle this is completely up to you the recommended best practice is to use the ctools object cache and a good way to do this is to write a couple of wrapper functions around the cache that look like these example functions get the cached changes to a given task handler function delegatorpagegetpagecache name ctoolsinclude objectcache cache ctoolsobjectcacheget delegatorpage name if cache cache delegatorpageload name cache locked ctoolsobjectcachetest delegatorpage name return cache store changes to a task handler in the object cache function delegatorpagesetpagecache name page ctoolsinclude objectcache cache ctoolsobjectcacheset delegatorpage name page remove an item from the object cache function delegatorpageclearpagecache name ctoolsinclude objectcache ctoolsobjectcacheclear delegatorpage name using these wrappers when performing a getcache operation it defaults to loading the real object it then checks to see if another user has this object cached using the ctoolsobjectcachetest function which automatically sets a lock which can be used to prevent writes later on with this set up the next finish and cancel callbacks are quite simple callback generated when the add page process is finished function delegatorpageaddsubtaskfinish formstate page formstate page create a real object from the cache delegatorpagesave page clear the cache delegatorpageclearpagecache formstate cache name callback generated when the next button is clicked all we do here is store the cache function delegatorpageaddsubtasknext formstate update the cache with changes delegatorpagesetpagecache formstate cache name formstate page callback generated when the cancel button is clicked all we do here is clear the cache function delegatorpageaddsubtaskcancel formstate update the cache with changes delegatorpageclearpagecache formstate cache name all that s needed to tie this together is to understand how the changes made it into the cache in the first place this happened in the various form submit handlers which made changes to formstate page based upon the values set in the form store the values from the basic settings form function delegatorpageformbasicsubmit form formstate if isset formstate page pid empty formstate page import formstate page name formstate values name formstate page admintitle formstate values admintitle formstate page path formstate values path no database operations were made during this submit and that s a very important

modal tool ctools provides a simple modal that can be used as a popup to place forms it differs from the normal modal frameworks in that it does not do its work via an iframe this is both an advantage and a disadvantage the iframe simply renders normal pages in a subbrowser and they can do their thing that makes it much easier to put arbitrary pages and forms in a modal however the iframe is not very good at actually communicating changes to the main page so you cannot open the modal have it do some work and then modify the page invoking the modal the basic form of the modal can be set up just by including the javascript and adding the proper class to a link or form that will open the modal to include the proper javascript simply include the library and call the addjs function ctoolsinclude modal ctoolsmodaladdjs you can have links and buttons bound to use the modal by adding the class ctoolsusemodal for convenience there is a helper function to try and do this though it s not great at doing all links so using this is optional render an image as a button link this will automatically apply an ajax class to the link and add the appropriate javascript to make this happen param image the path to an image to use that will be sent to theme image for rendering param dest the destination of the link param alt the alt text of the link param class any class to apply to the link todo this should be a options array function ctoolsmodalimagebutton image dest alt class return ctoolsajaxtextbutton theme image image dest alt class ctoolsusemodal render text as a link this will automatically apply an ajax class to the link and add the appropriate javascript to make this happen note html true so be sure any text is vetted chances are these kinds of buttons will not use user input so this is a very minor concern param image the path to an image to use that will be sent to theme image for rendering param dest the destination of the link param alt the alt text of the link param class any class to apply to the link todo this should be a options array function ctoolsmodaltextbutton text dest alt class return ctoolsajaxtextbutton text dest alt class ctoolsusemodal like with all ctools ajax functionality the href of the link will be the destination with any appearance of nojs converted to ajax for submit buttons however the url may be found a different slightly more complex way if you do not wish to simply submit the form to the modal you can create a url using hidden form fields the id of the item is taken and url is appended to it to derive a class name then all form elements that contain that class name are founded and their values put together to form a url for example let s say you have an add button and it has a select form item that tells your system what widget it is adding if the id of the add button is editadd you would place a hidden input with the base of your url in the form and give it a class of editaddurl you would then add editaddurl as a class to the select widget allowing you to convert this value to the form without posting if no url is found the action of the form will be used and the entire form posted to it customizing the modal if you do not wish to use the default modal the modal can be customized by creating an array of data to define a customized modal to do this you add an array of info to the javascript settings to define the customizations for the modal and add an additional class to your modal link or button to tell it which modal to use first you need to create a settings array you can do this most easily with a bit of php drupaladdjs array mymodalstyle array modalsize array type fixed width 250 height 250 setting the key to the array above in this case mymodalstyle is the identifier to your modal theme you can have multiple modal themes on a page so be sure to use an id that will not collide with some other module s use using your module or theme as a prefix is a good idea then when adding the ctoolsusemodal class to your link or button also add the following class ctoolsmodalid in the example case that would be ctoolsmodalmymodalstyle modalsize can be fixed or scale if fixed it will be a raw pixel value if scale it will be a percentage of the screen you can set  modalsize  an array of data to control the sizing of the modal it can contain  type  either fixed or scale  if fixed the modal will always be a fixed size if scale the modal will scale to a percentage of the browser window default scale  width  if fixed the width in pixels if scale the percentage of the screen expressed as a number less than zero for 80 percent use 8 for example  default 8 height  if fixed the height in pixels if scale the percentage of the screen expressed as a

ctoolsimagepath throbbergif t loading t loading  rendering within the modal to render your data inside the modal you need to provide a page callback in your module that responds more or less like a normal page in order to handle degradability it s nice to allow your page to work both inside and outside of the modal so that users whose javascript is turned off can still use your page there are two ways to accomplish this first you can embed nojs as a portion of the url and then watch to see if that turns into ajax when the link is clicked second if you do not wish to modify the urls you can check post js or post ctoolsjs to see if that flag was set the url method is the most flexible because it is easy to send the two links along completely different paths if necessary and it is also much easier to manually test your module s output by manually visiting the nojs url it s actually quite difficult to do this if you have to set post js to test in your hookmenu you can use the a

first argument to the page callback will be the result of ctoolsjsload which will return true if ajax was the string and false if anything else ie nojs is the string which means you can then declare

modules admin build modules note aggressive caching will complain that fivestar doesn t work but it actually causes no problems to improve performance the module implements hookinit and the caching advisor screen uses that as the only metric to determine whether a module will work with the caching system activate it without fear friends fivestar will continue to hum happily along upgrading from drupal 5 the drupal 6 version of votingapi has been significantly improved for both efficiency and flexibility because fivestar depends on votingapi for much of its functionality these changes have affected fivestar the fivestar anonymous vote interval set in admin settings fivestar is no longer available we use the same setting as defined in votingapi now set at admin settings votingapi it has the same effect as the previous fivestar setting configuration for simple rating fivestar has two completely separate modes of operation the first is letting an enduser rate a piece of content the settings for this are on the content type settings page these settings let you expose a rating widget when viewing the node not editing it clicking on the widget registers a vote for that node and never anything else the configuration for fivestar is spread between the content type settings page fivestar site settings page and access permissions to configure 1 configure the sitewide setting for fivestar administer settings fivestar 2 activate voting on each content type for example if you want fivestar to appear on story nodes use administer content management content types story and check the enable five star rating box under the five star ratings heading repeat for each content type desired 3 enable anonymous voting if you want to allow anonymous voting you ll need to set permissions for that use administer user management access control and check the rate content and view ratings checkboxes for the roles you d like you ll find these permission items under the fivestar module heading configuration for reviews of content fivestar can be used to quickly setup a rating system for your site visitors to review a piece of content when enabling the comment widget visitors will submit a rating on the original piece of content along with their comment visitors will not be rating the comments themselves fivestar does not allow for the rating of comments 1 if it s not already enabled turn on comment module at administer site building modules 2 visit the content type you want to enable reviews such as administer content management content types story and select an option under the comment widget section configuration as a cck field advanced rating fivestar has extensive cck support which makes it so that the user is presented with a widget to rate some node with the widget while editing a node it does not necessary rate the current node nor does it rate anything if no value is entered in the node id field when configuring the cck field the value is saved in the node so when you edit it it is still there but no vote is registered in votingapi without the node id field filled out an example of a situation where you might want to use the cck fivestar field is creating a node type called review this review type would let users rate some particular node and accompany their rating with a review this could be combined with a standard rating on the target node so that some users could rate the target node using the simple method or write a complete review to accompany their rating to configure a cck field for rating a node while creating a new review node 1 create a new node type called review at administer content management content types configure the type do not set any fivestar settings on the content type form we don t want users to actually be able to rate the reviews themselves 2 edit your new content type then click on the add field tab while on the content type form add a field called rating to your new type make it of type fivestar rating with the stars radio button 3 configure the rating widget to your liking most field have help text which explain their purpose the node id field is the most important field on the page which determines exactly what node will receive the value of the rating in a realy simple case you could just enter the value 10 to always rate on the same node with nid 10 usually you ll need to enter php code to dynamically select what node you want to rate a common scenario is using fivestar with nodecomments to make reviews if using nodecomments a separate checkbox appears the node id field to allow you easily select the nodecomment parent as the target of the vote save your field now when making new nodes of type review the user will select a star that will register a vote on the value of the node id field views integration fivestar depends on the views integration provided by votinapi but adds some special features to make it work specifically with fivestar to display fivestar ratings in a view select the votingapi percent vote result from the list of available fields this will display the average vote for nodes then choose fivestar rating from the handler options for the field and the averages will be displayed as fivestar ratings fivestar also provides handling for the display of fivestar cck fields they are in the field list under fivestar rating field name creating a fivestar set 1 open your favorite image editor and create an image that is 3 times as high as it is wide the default size for fivestar and the easiest to work with is 16x48 pixels 2 setup guides at 16 pixels and 32 pixels this splits your canvas into thirds 3 create a star icon in the top third when satisfied copy it into the middle and bottom thirds of the image change the middle and bottom copies to your liking fivestar will use the top middle and bottom images for each state of the star top off middle on bottom hover 4 save your image as starpng in a new directory the name of your directory will be the label for your set of stars spaces are not allowed 5 do the same thing for a cancel image only there are only 2 states for a cancel image so your image will be 16 pixels by 32pixels setup a guide at 16 pixels so your canvas is split in half 6 create a cancel icon in the top half then duplicate it into the bottom half the cancel states are simply off and hover top off bottom hover 7 save your cancel image as cancelpng in the directory create in step 4 8 create the css stylesheet the easiest way to make this stylesheet is to copy an existing css file from another set of stars the basic set provides an excellent example for a 16x16 star because it only changes the background image as necessary if you re making a larger or smaller size for your stars than 16x16 pixels the minimal and outline sets make for a good example creating a color enhanced fivestar set if contributing your set of stars back to the community creating a color enhanced version of your widget is an excellent way to make the stars usable by a large audience by slightly extending a basic widget you can make allow users to customize the colors in your fivestar set 1 similar to a basic star set create a new image that will be split in thirds vertically however color enhanced sets of stars are also split in half horizontally so you ll actually create 6 stars inside of a single image the default canvas size for a 16x16 star then is 32x48 pixels 2 setup guides at 16 and 32 pixels on the yaxis and another grid at 16 pixels on the xaxis 3 using the same method as a basic widget create stars for off on and hover states on the right side of your image the stars on the right side of the image will be used as an overlay while it s okay to use color for the overlay you ll generally only use white and black to add highlights or shadows to the colors the enduser will choose from the fivestar settings page 4 create matching stars on the left side of the image also for off on and hover states the stars on the left side will be used as the color mask the stars should be entirely black transparency is okay 5 save your image as startemplatepng make sure to format it as a 24bit png even though the template is a 24bit png which isn t compatible with ie6 the generated images can be either an 8bit png with a matte or 24bit png if no matte is chosen 6 repeat steps 1 through 6 for the cancel image only with a 32x32 pixel image for the off and hover states save the final images as canceltemplatepng and cancelpng 7 the two templatepng files will tell fivestar that the set is color enhanced and allow users to choose new colors for their stars contributing have a sweet set of stars you d like to contribute to the fivestar module post them to the fivestar issue queue http

an application named myapp has an url field for file url has a browse button with click event inline or set by jquery this can be a text link or anything that is clickable now let s go through the integration methods and define the openfilebrowser function that opens imce and makes it fill our url field on file selection integration by url when imce is opened using an url that contains app applicationname fileproperty1 fieldid1 fileproperty2 fieldid2 the specified fields are filled with the specified properties of the selected file avaliable file properties are url name size formatted width height date formatted bytes integer size in bytes time integer date timestamp id file id for newly uploaded files 0 or integer relpath rawurlencoded path relative to file directory path in our case we should open imce using this url imce app myapp url urlfield which contains our application name and our url field id function openfilebrowser windowopen imce app myapp url urlfield width 760 height 560 resizable 1 that s all we need leave the rest to imce it will automatically create an operation tab named send to myapp that sends the file url to our url field clicking the files in preview do the same thing as well what if we had another field for another file property eg size we should have opened imce using this url imce app myapp url urlfield size filesize using imceload you can point a predefined function to be executed when imce loads when the url is like app myapp imceload myonloadfunc imce looks for myonloadfunc in the parent window and executes it with the window parameter referring to imce window function myonloadfunc win any method of imce is available through winimce winimcesetsendto give it to myapplication baby myfilehandler you should also define myfilehandler using sendto you can point a predefined function to which the selected files are sent when the url is like app myapp sendto myfilehandler imce calls myfilehandler function of the parent window with file and window parameters function myfilehandler file win urlfieldid val fileurl insert file url into the url field winclose close imce usually sendto method is easier to implement on the other hand imceload method is more flexible as you manually add your sento operator and also can do any modification before imce shows up advanced integration in case your application wants to go beyond the simple give me that file property interaction with imce your application wants imce to send multiple files to it eg a gallery application your application wants to gain total control over

some things have moved in directions not forseen by this documentation for example there is less emphasis today on postal data and more emphasis on geocoding webservices please take this documentation with a grain of salt until it is fully cleaned up and brought up to date locationxxinc adding support for an unsupported country this file is a php programmer s description of what needs to be done in order to extend the location system to support locationes from a new country let s suppose we want to extend the location system to support locationes from belgium to this end there are 2 tasks task 1 we use the lowercase of the country s twoletter iso 3166 code to create a file locationbeinc that defines the necessary functions that will hook into the location system this way when a highlevel function in the public location api receives a call that uses some belgium specific function the call will be delegated to the appropriately named function in locationbeinc task 2 you need postal code data for your country this postal code data needs to be able to connect the baselength postal code eg us postal codes can be 9 digits but we re only interested to the level of 5 digits and most people only know the 5digit version to a city province state country duh and a latitude longitude pair in degrees that represents the approximate center of the postal code s area ultimately you will want to create a database dump that inserts these fields into specific columns zip for postal codes city for city names province for the standard state province country abbreviation country for the lowercase of the country s two letter iso code latitude for the latitude in degree value as opposed to radian value and longitude for the degree value of the longitude in a lot of countries this data costs money you cannot simply create a dump and then publish it on drupalorg unless the data is free to redistribute however if you are interested in buying this data from some vendor and using it on your own site you can do so but may have to acquire a new license for each seperate business or web site for which you wish to use postal code data if in fact you had to pay a fee or license for this data this postalcodetolat lon mapping is important if you want to enable locationbased proximity searches of anykind for addresses in a particular country the module will still work fine without it but will not be able to support searches based on postal codes contents of locationbeinc this file will need to implement a handful of functions with the parameters and return values described below it is possible to not implement all of these functions since the caller usually checks to see if the function exists before calling it but it may limit the number of features the location system will be able to support for your country for an example implementation of the functions described below see supported locationusinc function themelocationbe location hide param location an associative array location where street the street portion of the location additional additional street portion of the location city the city of the location province the province state or territory country lowercased twoletter iso code required postalcode the international postal code for this location required param hide an linear array where the values are the location fields to suppress in the themed display return a string of the themed location the entire location should be enclosed by dl class location dl tags the different lines of the location should be enclosed by dl dl tags the idea is to allow countryspecific files to change the display of an location from the default theming done in themelocation defined in locationinc function locationprovincelistbe returns an associative array where the keys are the alluppercase standard postal abbreviation for provinces territories and like subdivisions the values are the fully spelled names of the abbreviated names preferrably these will be sorted

with encoded http get variables to a free onlinemapping service note url not html link null if there is not even enough information to generate even a semiuseful link useful may depend entirely on the mapping service you choose to link to you are advised to experiment usually a city province combination is enough as is a postal code by itself however some services get confused when all fields are supplied some mapping services will be unable to map a city province location while they can t do anything with a postal code while others map postal codes fine but can t do anything useful with a city province pair function locationmaplinkbeproviders returns an array of mapping services to which the generation of deeplinks is supported supported means that the function for that particular mapping service has been defined for example if the locationbeinc file for belgium has functions for taking a location and generating a deeplink to yahoo maps and google this function will return that list in an array that give additional info see locationusinc for an example return an associative array where the keys are single words no spaces that identify a function in the same file for returning a deep link for example yahoo means locationmaplinkbeyahoo google means locationmaplinkbegoogle the values are themselves associative arrays with 3 expected keys name the name of the mapping service in the case of yahoo it would be yahoo maps url the full url of the main page of the mapping service ie the home page tos the full url of the terms of service for the mapping service function locationmaplinkbedefaultproviders returns an array of default mapping services it may happen that the site administrator has not yet made it to the settings page for selecting mapping providers in this case we want to tell the location modules which one to use as defaults to help the site admin avoid being in violation of each mapping services s terms of service we return a linear array whose values are the appropriately selected keys in the array returned the locationmaplinkxxproviders function return a linear array with the oneword nospaced identifiers used to identify the mapping function these should only be for the mapping services with relatively lenient and permissive terms of service important for more information on how to add support for deeplinks you are encouraged to

',0),(248,'help',' readme description this module gets around two quirks in the 6x core node module currently the node module causes access grants to be ignored for unpublished content ors together access grants coming from multiple modules this results in content being made accessible by one module when access had already been restricted by another which is undesirable in most cases the module ensures that access grants are tested for unpublished content just as they are for published content so that using the workflow module or any other module that uses the nodeaccess table you can implement workflows that deal effectively with content moving from author via moderator to publisher before it is published which is where it s needed most once content is visible for all to see it s a bit late to start a publication workflow process using taxonomy access control or lite you can restrict access to content to userdefined vocabularies such as departments or regions with module grants this will work for unpublished content just as it does for published content moreover when workflow and tac or taclite are used together this module makes sure that the combination exhibits the expected behaviour access is granted to content only when it is in the correct state and of the appropriate vocabulary term such as department country etc the modulegrants module achieves this by anding rather than oring the grants module grants comes bundled with module grants monitor optional which provides users with a new menu item accessible content that shows a list of all content accessible to the loggedin user based on the permissions and access grants as determined by enabled modules this list may be filtered using a double row of tabs residing at the top of the page see point 3a below installation and configuration 1 place the modulegrants folder in your sites all modules directory 2 under administer site building modules enable module grants and optionally module grants monitor recommended 3a visit administer user management permissions make sure that roles that are meant to be able to view unpublished and not yet published content have one of the following permissions o view revisions section node module or o view any all content section revisioning module if revisioning installed make sure that the role of anonymous user does not have any of the above permissions 3b there s usually no need to tick administer nodes for any role which is good because administer nodes equates to almost godlike powers that you wouldn t normally give to normal users 4 if required install and enable as many modules for content access control as you need for your situation typical examples are taxonomy access control or use tac lite and workflow 5 optional but highly recommended especially when using revisioning under administer user management permissions section modulegrantsmonitor module select for each role which filtering tab they will get to use the permissions which are in alphabetical rahter than logical order relate to two rows of tabs that appear on the accessible content page the first row of up to 4 tabs filter content the loggedin user created modified can edit can view the second row of up to 3 tabs further filter content according to it being published unpublished includes previously published as well as not yet published either all that is no additional filtering note 1 you must tick at least one permission box for each of the 2 rows note 2 these tick boxes only determine whether the role in question gets to see the tabs they do not in any way affect access to content so in that sense you can safely tick any or all of the tab boxes for all authenticated users however you may not want to confuse certain roles with too many tabs and too much output usage module grants monitor creates a new navigation menu item accessible content visible to the administrator and to roles to which the administrator granted access as per the above section point 5 the content shown under accessible content reflects the access grants given by modules installed on your system to the current user you can use module grants in combination with tac or taclite for finegrained access control based on vocabularies such as department assigned to the various content types you can then create departmentspecific roles eg sports author music author and enforce that these roles can only access content belonging to their departments whether it s published or not create your grants schemes on this page administer user management access control by taxonmy in addition you may want to install the workflow module to further segragate roles eg author and moderator via access control based on states such as in draft in review and published see administer site building workflow the module makes sure that access to content is given only when both the tac lite and the workflow access modules grant it as opposed to one or the other this module also works well with the revisioning module for creating effective publication workflows operating on published as well as unpublished content revisions see the revisioning project page at http drupalorg project revisioning for three stepbystep tutorials be aware that any permissions given in the node module section override the access grants given by the workflow and taclite modules so you probably only want to assign a few creation permissions in the node module and grant view update and delete via tac taclite and or workflow additional configuration options are found at

datastructure almost nothing in panels is hardcoded every level of its rendering process is controlled by plugins of the ctools variety and therefore can be overriden some of these plugins behaviors are obvious from the ui whereas others are much more underthehood most site builders and module authors will find that plugins are the only way they need to interact with panels to do what they want however if you are building whole new uis applications that are to be driven by the panels engine you ll also need the more traditional api that manages panels editing and crud panels node and mini panels are examples of applications in this sense as is og panels  this page is divided into two sections the first dealing with panels rendering system the plugins the drive it and the second with the requirements for creating a panelsdriven application ui the former is a good starting place and should be of interest to anyone wanting to begin working with the panels api the panels rendering system panels rendering system takes a fullyloaded panelsdisplay object and turns it into html it doesn t care how that object was built or where it comes from it s just a rendering engine so long as the calling code provides a wellformed panelsdisplay object the engine will spit out html exactly how that process works is determined entirely by plugins panels utilizes eight different types of plugins within its rendering system four owned by panels and four by ctools let s run through that list layout plugins owned by panels layout plugins provide the html output skeleton for any panel they define a set of regions and optionally accompanying css js very analogous to how themes define block regions while layout plugins with complex logic are possible the flexible layout for example most layouts are nothing more than a region list a tplphp skeleton and some css style plugins owned by panels style plugins control the markup that wraps both individual panes and whole panel regions a basic style plugin need not provide more than some basic css and a theme function or tplphp file style bases owned by ctools panels implements the stylebases plugin type in order to interact with the stylizer system which technically lives in ctools though true ownership is a little blurred regardless panels uses this plugin to interact with stylaizer in order to allow the creation of style plugins in the ui this plugin is probably of interest only to module developers site builders can safely skip it context plugins owned by ctools context plugins are abstracted wrappers around bits of data a node user or taxonomy term are easy examples panels uses context plugins so that it can work with all these different bits of data without caring about the details of the datastructure itself context can be a confusing concept and you can learn more in the ctools help  note that argument and relationship plugins are technically also used by panels but because they re really means for creating more context they don t get separate entries in this list content type plugins owned by ctools can utilize context at the heart of the panels rendering process content type plugins define the rendering logic for every pane offering panels a renderable chunk from your module means defining one of these for those accustomed to the block system they can be thought of as a more verbose block definition contained neatly inside a single plugin content type plugins rely on context to provide them with source data when necessary this makes content plugins nice and portable access plugins owned by ctools can utilize context access plugins are essentially portable access checking logic responsible for answering yes or no given some contextual data panels uses these to define visibility rules on individual panes the other place these are commonly seen is in defining selection rules on page manager variants if your module introduces new permissioning concepts or access logic not a basic hookperm implementation you may want to consider also encapsulating that logic in one or more of these plugins for example organic groups might implement an access plugin to allow deny based on group membership or the date module might implement allow deny logic based on request time cache plugins owned by panels should utilize context panels cache plugins define caching strategies that can be applied to individual panes or to whole displays caching plugins must deal with two basic issues the cache backend to use for reading writing and ttlmanaging strategies ttl strategies can and should integrate heavily with the context as that is where the real differential benefit of panelsbased caching is vs standard core caching display renderers owned by panels utilizes everything else in the simplest terms display renderers take a fullyloaded panelsdisplay object and render it they are very complex powerful plugins one could use them to cause panels to bypass every single other plugin in this list fortunately there is virtually no circumstance under which one would need to implement these plugins in the process of building a single site only contrib developers working on highly complex use cases are likely to ever need them in short each display renderer plugin is a selfcontained panels rendering engine if you want to grok the panels rendering system study these panelsbased applications at its core panels is a rendering engine with no ui though it does provide common elements for reuse in admin uis so if you re working with panels via the web ui it means you re working with a panels application the three that ship with this version of panels are mini panels panel nodes and the integration with ctools page manager panels also implements a taskhandler plugin which is owned by page manager in ctools task handlers aren t strictly a part of panels rendering system itself though strictly speaking they wrap it so we won t cover them here  ',0),(180,'help',' layout plugins getting started  layout plugins are one of the simplest and most powerful sections of the panels api there are two different ways that a layout can be implemented via panels panels supports both module and theme implementations of panels the module implementation requires that hookctoolsplugindirectory define the directory in which your layout plugins exist this same hook defines the directory for all panels plugins alternately if you intend on implementing a layout in a theme this can be done primary through the theme s info file the ctools help does a great job of actually explaining this portion of the api ctools plugins  ctools explains even the layout hooks a little in its example but we ll recap quickly and expand on this information as ctools explains the actual plugin file must be named with care as it will directly affect your naming scheme for the hook within it this is really no different from any other hook within drupal except that we ll be using multiple replacements in this case the function we re looking to implement is an instance of function yourmodulepluginnameownermoduleplugintype in our case we already know that the function will be function yourmodulepluginnamepanelslayouts this is because the plugin type we re working with is a layout and the module that implements these layouts is the panels module for the rest of the naming scheme yourmodule will be replaced with either the name of your module that implements this layout or the name of the theme and pluginname will be replaced with whatever the name of the plugin file is for purposes of this example our module name us going to be layoutsample and our plugin will be firstlayout  directory structure  we re going to assume that you ve laid your directory structure out very similarly to how panels does it something like this is rather likely layoutsample layoutsampleinfo layoutsamplemodule plugins layouts firstlayout firstlayoutcss firstlayoutinc firstlayoutpng layoutsamplefirstlayouttplphp the name of our inc file is going to be the key to the entire layout plugin the inc file  we will start with the firstlayoutinc file as it s the most important file we re dealing with here firstlayoutinc will look similar to the following plugin array title t first layout icon firstlayoutpng theme layoutsamplefirstlayout css firstlayoutcss panels array main t main region right t right region the include file defines all the other files that our layout will utilize in order to be truly useful the array is fairly self explanitory but for the sake of specificity  title  the title of our layout utilized within the panels administration screens  icon  the graphical representation of our layout utilized within the panels administration screens  theme  the template file of our layout sharp eyed readers will note that the theme definition utilizes underscores instead of dashes and does not have tplphp after it this is refering to the layoutsamplefirstlayouttplphp file all the same it is simply how the naming convention works utilize dashes in the tpl file name and underscores when refering to it in your include file  css  the css file to be utilized for our layout utilized within the panels administration screens and when viewing the actual panel itself  panels  defines all the various regions within your panel this will be further utilized within our tplphp file there are many additional properties that can be added to the include file for purposes of this document we ll also make mention of the admin css property admin css is especially useful when utilizing a fixed width layout with fixed with panel regions this can break under most administrative circumstances and panels provides you with the ability to give an additional css layout for the administrative section it s a simple nicety and looks like this plugin array title t first layout icon firstlayoutpng theme layoutsamplefirstlayout css firstlayoutcss admin css firstlayoutadmincss panels array main t main region right t right region  the tplphp file  the tplphp file is very similar to any other template file within drupal the difference here is that we re being passed an array of regions through content and we also have a css id available to us for the entire panel in the form of cssid the template is very straight forward and will look

representations of its layouts i would heavily encourage you to modify these to suit your needs the css files admin and non will be included at the appropriate times simply set them up to fit your

password policy this module provides a way to specify a certain level of password complexity aka password hardening for user passwords on a system by defining a password policy a password policy can be defined with a set of constraints which must be met before a user password change will be accepted each constraint has a parameter allowing for the minimum number of valid conditions which must be met before the constraint is satisfied example an uppercase constraint with a parameter of 2 and a digit constraint with a parameter of 4 means that a user password must have at least 2 uppercase letters and at least 4 digits for it to be accepted current constraints include digit constraint letter constraint letter digit constraint alphanumeric length constraint uppercase constraint lowercase constraint punctuation constraint character types constraint allows the adminstrator to set the minimum number of character types required but without actually dictating which ones must be used example windows requires any 3 user s choice of uppercase lowercase numbers or punctuation history constraint checks hashed password against a collection of users previous hashed passwords looking for recent duplicates username constraint the module also implements configurable password expiration features when a password is not changed for a certain amount of time the user is blocked expiration of the passwords can begin after expiration time after enabling of the policy or immediately all users with a passwords older then expiration time will be blocked retroactive behavior the notifications

modules directory ie sites all modules and enable rate on admin build modules optional modules chart to view the charts in the vote results tab you also need to install the chart module which you can get at http drupalorg project chart date the date module is a requirement for the rate expiration module 2 configuration after installation the configuration page will be available at admin build rate this page shows a list with available widgets each widget have an edit and delete link you can add a tab on the form below add widget in this form you have to choose a widget type see section 3 for more information on this topic both editing and adding a widget leads to the widget configuration see 21 if you want users other than admin to access the voting results page you need to give them the view rate results page permission on admin user permissions 21 widget configuration the elements on the widget configuration form are explained in this paragraph note that some elements may not be available depending on the widget type you use these are value type options and translate options title the title is only used in the admin section use a recognizable name machine readable name name used for technical purposes you may only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores tag this is the tag used by votingapi to store the voting results voting results from different tags are never merged you can use this to allow multiple ratings on the same node ie for comfort location services etc the default tag for ratings is vote use this value if you do not allow ratings on specific aspects value type this determines how vote results are totaled votingapi supports three value types by default percentage votes are averaged points votes are summed up and options votes get a count of votes cast for each specific option typical usages are thumbs up down use points bad mediocre good use percentage makes me funny boring mad angry use options options these are the options displayed to the user each option has a value and a label see 22 for more information on how to configure options translate options this checkbox determines if the labels used for the options should be translated node types check the node types on which a rate widget should be available there are separate columns for nodes and comments in this table node display determines where the widget will be placed there are three options do not add automatically the widget is added in the node object but not within the content array this only makes sense if you place the widget somewere by hand in the node theming above the content the content will be prepended by the widget below the content selected by default the widget is appended to the content within the links add the widget inside the links section display in teaser check this box if you want the widget to be visible in the node teaser appearance in full node display mode when full node is displayed options are full widget display the full clickable widget display only display the full widget in disabled state links are not clickable display only compact compact widget in disabled state compact clickable widget but without information line appearance in teaser display mode when node teaser is displayed comment display same as node display but for comments display mode when displayed for comments description this is an optional description which is displayed under the rate widget display description in compact mode which rating should be displayed determines which rating to display options are average rating always display the average rating users vote if available empty otherwise display the users vote if the user has not voted already there is no voting result displayed users vote if available average otherwise display the users vote if the user has not voted already the average vote is displayed which rating should be displayed when the user just voted same as previous question applies directly after the user has voted it is recommended to set this to users vote to provide a visible feedback after a user has voted roles check the roles which are allowed to vote using this widget all roles are allowed to vote if no roles are checked behaviour when user has no permissions to vote if the user may not vote on the widget what needs to be done options are redirect to login and show message the widget is visible just as if you may vote on in if the user clicks on a button the user is redirected to the user page which shows the message you must login before you can vote the user is redirected back to the page with the rate widget after login redirect to login but do not show a message this behaviour is the same as the first option except for the fact that it does not display a message show a disabled widget with non clickable buttons the user is able to see the widget but cannot click on it hide widget the widget is not visible to the user if he does not have the permission to vote 22 options options are the buttons dispayed in the widget these can be visually different depending on the theming options are generated as html links by default each option has a value and a label only the label is visible for the user but the value is what he actually votes for when clicking the button values have to be configured according to the following rules values must be integers may be negative thus 1 2 0 3 are all right but 23 is wrong values must be unique across all options within the same widget which value you should use depends on the value type setting when using points these are the points which will be added when clicking that button so thumbs up must have the value 1 thumbs down the value 1 and neutral 0 for percentage you have to use whole numbers between 0 and 100 when using options you may use any number as long as they are unique it doesn t have to make sense as they are only used for storage 3 widget types technically widget types are sets of value types and options see 21 they are called templates in code some widget types have the option to let the user customize the options others don t allow the user to do that but all widget types have a predefined set of options you may create widgets without choosing a template by selecting the custom type by using custom you have to add the theming for this widget see section 4 widget types can be extended by 3rd party modules the following widget types are provided by the rate module thumbs up thumbs up down number up down fivestar emotion yes no slider 4 theming default templates for theming are ratewidgettplphp this is the default template for all custom widgets ratewidgetnametplphp this is a widget specific template use the machine name for name replace underscores by dashes in this name this template is only available for custom widgets theming for noncustom widget types are defined in the module which provides the widget type you may use the following snippets in the template print a button for a single option 0 is the first option see 21 for a thumbs up down configuration you will have print the rating when using value type percentage or points print the number of votes for a specific option only available when using value type options 0 is the first option see 21 print the total number of votes for thumbs up down widgets there are 2 special variables available which provides the percentage of votes for up and down you can choose to not automatically add the widget to the node template in that case the widget can be used as replace name by the widget s machine readable name 5 voting results voting results are available on the voting results page you can get there by clicking the voting results tab on the node page note that this tab is hidden if the node does not have any rate widgets or if you do not have the view rate results permission when the chart module is enabled you will find charts of the results in the last 30 days on this page the chart may show less than 30 days if there was no activity on all days the voting results page is only available for nodes 6 views integration this module provides views integration via the votingapi module to add a rate widget in your view first add a relation to node vote results for nodes or comment vote results for comments you have to configure a few options here the value type and vote tag needs to be the same as used for the widget see 21 the aggregate function must be number of votes after adding the relationship you can add the field vote results value to your view in the appearance box you may choose one of the following rate widget display only this shows a disabled widget uses are allowed to see the results but cannot click the buttons rate widget compact this shows a compact widget this is the basic widget without the textual information rate widget this shows the full widget as on the node page when using a view on nodes you are advised to add the node type field to your view fields if you do not an additional query will be executed per row you may exclude this field from display 7 expiration close voting on a specified date the optional rate expiration module allows you to close voting on a specified date when adding or editing a rate widget you will find the following options disable voting after this period when set voting is closed when the configured period has

description this modules forces new unpublished content as well as edits to current content to first go into a queue for review by a moderator publisher rather than immediately becoming live ie visible to the public we took our inspiration from the revision moderation module by angie byron but found that a patch could not implement the deviating functionality our customers required which would change the current behaviour of the rm module and surprise existing users in the rm module the permissions to edit and revert publish content are lumped together so that it isn t possible to enforce separation of these responsibilites by role this module allows you to assign distinct permissions for authors to only create and edit content and moderator roles to review publish revert unpublish and optionally delete content no unnessary revisions are created when saving a revision that is pending menu navigation has been altered so that users first pick the desired revision before being allowed to view edit publish revert unpublish or delete triggers are provided for the publish unpublish and revert events by taking advantage of the module grants module this module integrates better with the workflow and taxonomy access control lite modules this means that you can easily implement finegrained content access control based on categories as well as workflow states with both module grants and revisioning installed this all works for both published and unpublished content there s also a publishpendingrevision action that may be triggered from a workflow state transition like in review publish unlike rm revisioning does not require any additional database tables installation 0 install the module grants module this is a package containing 4 modules although highly recommended the main module in this package is not required but the node tools submodule is module grants monitor is also recommended although revisioning features similar functionality through a canned view for which you ll naturally have to install views 1 optionally install the diff module if you want to compare revisions and highlight the differences 2 place the revisioning folder in your sites all modules directory enable revisioning under administer site building modules configuration 3 under administer content content types click edit next to the content types for which you wish to enable disable revisioning under workflow settings default options tick both the create new revision and new revision in draft pending moderation checkboxes also in this section untick published so that all new content is created in an unpubished state ie invisible to the public new revision in draft pending moderation means that when a user edits and saves a piece of content the new revision isn t automatically made current the previous copy remains unchanged and visible to the public until the newer revision is published in its place there is an additional radiobutton on the same page that augments the above behaviour giving you the option to only create a new revision when saving content that is not already in draft pending moderation this will save you some disk space because until the draft is published all modifications will be applied to the same copy ie no new revision is created when one already exists on the other hand there are situations for instance with a wiki page with multiple authors editing the same copy where you do want every save to create a new draft revision so that contributors can compare what was changed between saves the diff module is a good addition to revisioning for this 4 revisioning builds on the accessible content menu item if you have enabled module grants monitor adding the in draft pending publication filter to the double row of tabs 5 grant to the various roles the view delete revert revisions permissions node access section and the edit revisions permission revisioning section typically you d give authors the view revisions and edit revisions permissions while moderators will get the same as well as the publish revert revisions permission neither require the administer nodes permission which is a good thing as this gives ordinary users excessive rights usage you should now be in business log in as one of the authors and create content save log out then log in as a moderator to publish the content via the accessile content pending tab if you installed module grants monitor or via the content summary menu option if you installed views click on the title of the post then open the desired revision by clicking on the date check the content the press the publish this tab note that up to this point content isn t visible to the public log in as an author again and revise the content you will notice that upon saving the new revision the one visible to the public remains unchanged log in as a moderator again to promote publish the revised content to live as an alternative to the accessible content menu item you may want to activate the pending revisions block this block is particularly useful for moderators as it constantly shows the latest content requiring moderator attention in an inobtrusive corner of the screen configure and enable the block like any other on the administer site building blocks page you can use this module in combination with tac or taclite for finegrained access control based on vocabularies such as region or department associated with the various content types be aware that any permissions given in the node module section override those granted via tac taclite so you probably only want to assign a few creation permissions in the node module and do the view update and delete grants via tac taclite in addition you may want to install the workflow module to further segragate the author and moderator roles via access control based on states such as in draft in review and live workflow also allows you to notify users when state transitions occur eg when a moderator declines or publishes a submitted revision stepbystep guides on the usage of the revisioning module in combination with the taclite and workflow modules can be found on the revisioning

under the gpl version 2 the unique field module provides a way to require that specified fields or characteristics of a node are unique this includes the node s title author language taxonomy terms and cck fields without this module drupal and cck do not prevent multiple nodes from having the same title or the same value in a given field for example if you have a content type with a date field and there should only be one node per date you could use this module to prevent a node from being saved with a date already used in another node this module adds additional options to the content type administration page for specifying which fields must be unique the administrator may specify whether each field must be unique or whether the fields in combination must be unique also the administrator can choose whether the fields must be unique among all other nodes or only among nodes from the given node s content type alternatively you can select the single node scope which allows you to require that the specified fields are each unique on that node for example if a node has multiple separate user reference fields this setting will require that no user is selected more than

thehunmonkgroup at yahoo dot com this module provides various editing protection for users the protections can be specific to a user or applied to all users in a role the following protections are supported username email address password status changes roles deletion openid identities both adding and deleting all edits any accessed via user x edit when a protection is enabled for a specified user or the protection is enabled because the user belongs to a role that has the protection it prevents the editing operation in question that anyone might try to perform on the user unless an administrator who is permitted to bypass the protection is editing the specified user the module will protect fields by disabling them at user x edit user administrators may be configured to bypass specified protections on either a global or peradministrator basis these protections are valid both when trying to edit the user directly from their user x edit page or using the mass user editing operations the module also provides protection at the paths user x edit and user x delete should anyone try to visit those paths directly note this module is compatible with the roleassign module settings at administer user management userprotect you ll find the settings for the module when the module is initially enabled the default settings are such user administrators bypass all protections the root user specifically bypasses all protections the anonymous user uid 0 and root user uid 1 are protected from all edits deletion and openid operations all role protections are disabled the change own email change own password and change own openid permissions are enabled for authenticated users in the userprotect section at administer user management access control this effectively amounts to no protections it is suggested that you turn off as many default administrator bypass settings as possible and set bypass settings for specific user administratorsthis allows you to take advantage of the status roles deletion openid and edit protections in a meaningful way because of the peruser bypass protection settings for the anonymous and root user this will also begin protecting those users without compromising the root user s access to the entire site important note in order to protect a user from deletion by visiting user x delete directly and or openid edits by visiting user x openid directly you must enable the delete and or openid protection specifically enabling all account edits does not enable these protections also note that this module only provides protection against actions via the website interfaceoperations that a module takes directly are not protected this module should play well with other contributed modules but there is no guarantee that all protections will remain intact if you install modules outside of the drupal core installation adding protections for a single user this is done at administer user management userprotect protected users any time a user is added for protection they will initially receive the default protections enabled at administer user management userprotect protection defaults adding protections for roles this is done at administer user management userprotect protected roles be cautious about adding protections by role or you can lock out users from things unintentionally in particular note the if you enable role protections for a specific role and you have no bypasses enabled you ve effectively locked out any role editing for that role by anybody unless you come back to the settings page and disable the role protection adding administrator bypass rules one of the more powerful features of the module are the administrator bypass settings any user that has been granted the administer users permission can be configured to bypass any protection either via the default administrator bypass settings at administer user management userprotect protection defaults or via a peradministrator setting at administer user management userprotect administrator bypass if a bypass is enabled for a user administrator they will be given editing rights on that protection regardless if it is enabled for a single user or an entire role note that the peradministrator bypass settings override the default bypass settings default protection settings set the default protections for newly protected users at administer user management userprotect protection defaults in addition you can enable the autoprotect feature which will automatically add the default protections to any newly created user accounts and set default bypass options for all user administrators how the module determines a protection in order to properly use user protect it s important to understand how the module determines if a specified field is to be protected here is the basic logic if the current user is a user administrator check if they have peradministrator bypass settings if so then check to see if they are allowed to bypass the protection if so then stop the checks and allow editing of the field if not then if the current user is a user administrator check if the default administrator bypass is enabled for the protection in question if so then stop the checks and allow editing of the field if not check if the user is editing their own account if so determine the protections for email password and openid by examining the userprotect permissions for change own email change own password and change own openid then continue with the rest of the checks below if not check if the protection is set for the individual user being edited if so then stop the checks here and prevent editing of the field this effectively means that individual protections override role protections if not then examine all the roles for the user being edited if any of those roles have the protection enabled then prevent editing of the field if not then allow the field to be edited note if a user is editing their own account they are never protected from editing their own username email password or openid administrators can still limit the ability of users to change their username via the rolebased permission at administer user management access control  ',0),(85,'help',' readme quick start guide click site building views add view name test view type node click add display to create a new page click style

path none and type test then click update click save then view page topright corner enjoy your first vbo technical details the module works by exposing a new views 2 style plugin called bulk operations the settings for this plugin allow to choose the operations that should appear on the view operations are gathered from two sources 1 action api 2 hooknodeoperations and hookuseroperations the module also allows to use batch api or the job queue module to process the selected nodes in order to avoid timeouts vbo can support all object types supported by views natively vbo comes with support for nodes users and comments through the new vbodefined hookviewsbulkoperationsobjectinfo other modules can help vbo handle arbitrary object types refer to function viewsbulkoperationsviewsbulkoperationsobjectinfo for information example vbo as an example the module comes with a reimplementation of the content admin page to access it just go to the url admin content node2 you can modify the path to admin content node to override the default content admin page included actions modify node taxonomy terms the module comes with a new action to manipulate nodes taxonomy terms unlike taxonomy node operations which creates a new action for each single term this module exposes a single configurable action that allows the user to choose which term s should be added to the selected nodes the user can also choose to keep existing terms or to erase them delete node user comment actions to delete these objects rulesets actions detect rulesets created with the rules module and expose them as actions that vbo can invoke arbitrary php script write php code that is applied to each node in vbo this action requires the administer site configuration permission even if actionspermissionsmodule says otherwise modify node fields bulkmodify cck and other node fields modify profile fields bulkmodify user profile fields modify user roles assign and unassign roles to users managing blocks the views block module part of views hacks exposes block data to views allowing vbo to manage blocks just as nodes or users try it out faq even though the action gets called on my selected nodes these nodes still retain their old values what s going on actions in d6 use a flag called changesnodeproperty to give a hint to drupal whether this action modifies node contents or performs a readonly operation on the node vbo uses that flag to determine whether nodesave should be called or not after executing the action actions that modify node contents but don t expose this flag in hookactioninfo will not be properly handled by vbo checkout nodemodule s nodeactioninfo implementation for an example how can i write an action that performs a function on all selected nodes at once you need to write a node operation instead of an action whereas actions get called once for every selected node node operations are called once only and they are passed an array of selected nodes check out sirkitree s article for the same concept applied to user operations note if you use batch api to execute your actions vbo will revert to calling the action once per node instead this is because it doesn t make sense to batch one single action i need vbo to modify thousands of nodes at once help vbo is designed to handle large numbers of nodes without causing memory errors or timeouts when you select thousands of nodes you can choose to execute the operations using batch api which provides visual feedback on vbo s progress to select batch api edit your view open the bulk operation style settings and in the section to execute operations select use batch api you can also choose to execute the operations during cron runs via the job queue module if you have it enabled how can i use vbo to copy values from one field to another you will need to write simple php code install devel and open the dev load tab on a node of the type you want to manipulate write down the name of the source field as well as the array key that contains the field value eg fieldcontact array 0 array value some value use the stock vbo at admin content node2 and filter the nodes by the desired type then choose the action modify node fields and press execute on the set parameters for modify node fields page locate the destination field and check it on in the code area of that field write the script needed to copy the value from the source field the help text below the code area shows you the expected format and you can access the node being manipulated using the variable node eg return array 0 array value node fieldcontact 0 value press next then confirm how can i make sure that unauthorized users are prevented from destroying nodes or any other parts of my drupal installation vbo gives a lot of power to admins so it s important that security measures be enforced there are currently 3 different ways to restrict access to vbo 1 using the bundled actionspermissions module the admin can set permissions on each individual action vbo honors those permissions by hiding the unauthorized actions and checking permissions again when it is about to execute an action 2 vbo also calls nodeaccess on each node that is about to be acted upon nodes for which the user does not have appropriate permissions are discarded from the execution list the action flag changesnodeproperty is mapped to nodeaccess update there are other mappings as well described in the vbo development guide 3 the author of actions can specify additional permissions in hookactioninfo under the attribute permissions array perm1 perm2 what is the difference between these pairs of actions make post sticky nodemakestickyaction vs make sticky nodemassupdate c4d794

changes description the pathauto module provides support functions for other modules to automatically generate aliases based on appropriate criteria with a central settings path for site administrators implementations are provided for core content types nodes taxonomy terms and users including blogs and tracker pages pathauto also provides a way to delete large numbers of aliases this feature is available at administer site building url aliases delete aliases benefits besides making the page address more reflective of its content than node 138 it s important to know that modern search engines give heavy weight to search terms which appear in a page s url by automatically using keywords based directly on the page content in the url relevant search engine hits for your page can be significantly enhanced installation and upgrades see the installtxt file notices pathauto just adds url aliases to nodes users and taxonomy terms because it s an alias the standard drupal url for example node 123 or taxonomy term 1 will still function as normal if you have external links to your site pointing to standard drupal urls or hardcoded links in a module template node or menu which point to standard drupal urls it will bypass the alias set by pathauto there are reasons you might not want two urls for the same content on your site if this applies to you please note that you will need to update any hard coded links in your nodes or blocks if you use the system path ie node 10 for menu items and settings like that drupal will replace it with the urlalias for external links you might want to consider the path redirect or global redirect modules which allow you to set forwarding either per item or across the site to your aliased urls urls not getting replaced with aliases please bear in mind that only urls passed through drupal s l or url functions will be replaced with their aliases during page output if a module or your template contains hardcoded links such as href node node nid those won t get replaced with their corresponding aliases use the drupal api instead href url node node nid or l your link title node node nid see http apidrupalorg api head function url and http apidrupalorg api head function l for more information disabling pathauto for a specific node type or taxonomy when the pattern for a node type is left blank the default pattern will be used but if the default pattern is also blank pathauto will be disabled for that node type bulk updates must be run multiple times as of 5x2x pathauto now performs bulk updates in a manner which is more likely to succeed on large sites the drawback is that it needs to be run multiple times if you want to reduce the number of times that you need to run pathauto you can increase the maximum number of objects to alias in a bulk update setting under general settings wysiwyg conflicts fckeditor tinymce etc if you use a wysiwyg editor please disable it for the pathauto admin page failure to do so may

module is installled it s possible to use various content data for the autogenerated title eg use the text of a cck field advanced users can also provide some php code that is used for automatically generating an appropriate title installation optional download and install the token module copy the module s directory to your modules directory and activate the module for each content type you want

for the current content type advanced use php code you can access node from your php code look at this simple example which just adds the node s author as title advanced use combining tokens and php you can combine php evalution with the token module because tokens are replaced first however be aware to don t use this with any textual values provided by users as this would open a security hole if you are in doubt don t combine tokens with php evaluation here is an example so if the text of the cck number fieldtestnumber isn t empty it will be used as title otherwise the node type will be used

overwhelming at first but there are really just a few things you have to know the rest you can find through exploration the views edit ui image below gives an overview of what you ll find on the edit ui the views edit ui notes 1 every view has a number of displays which represent where output will be placed if you re familiar with the original views 1 you could set a view to be a page with a url path or a block that could show up in a sidebar with views 2 you can add as many displays as you like in addition you have the default display which contains the basic settings but doesn t actually show up anywhere 2 when you click on the link for an item a form will open up for browsers with smaller resolutions you may have to scroll down a little to see this form if a form is open the item its attached to will be highlighted 3  overrides mean that a particular display is not using default settings when you create a new display many of its settings will start off using default values this will be indicated by italics and a lighter color if you change these values without first overriding them you will change the default value for all displays that use them 4 some items particularly styles have additional settings ordinarily when you update a style if it has additional settings you will automatically see that form next often you will need to go directly to those settings 5 you can safely leave a view page to go and do other things if you come back the view will still be there stored in a cache keep in mind however that while you do this that view is locked  meaning another user cannot edit this view without breaking the lock breaking the lock will discard your changes it helps to have something particular in mind that you want to accomplish when using views here are a

block that shows the titles of recent blog entries by an author when viewing one of their posts this will demonstrate using views arguments to dynamically filter a view s contents at display time before working through this example enable the blog module and populate some entries from a few different users creating the view the first step is creating a view for our recent blog entries block because the block will show the titles of blog entries this view is considered a node type go to add new view  enter the following properties and click next  view name recentblogentries view description list of recent blog entries for a given author view tag blog view type node generating a list of blog entries it will be much easier to see the view progress if we can see it doing something in this section we will create a basic view displaying blog entry titles in the third column locate the fields area generally speaking fields are the pieces of information that you want to display in the view in this case node title click the   icon to add a field scroll down to defaults add fields  below the settings table a large selection of fields will be available in the groups dropdown menu select node  this will limit the list to only the default fields exposed by node module scroll down the list select the node title field and click add  you will now be presented with settings for the node title field delete the label from the label field so that each individual node title is not prefixed with the word title additionally check the link this field to its node box so that visitors who see an interesting title can click directly on it to read the blog entry to which it belongs when finished click update  if you scroll down to the live preview section you should now see a list of several node titles however both blog entries and other node types will be in the list let s fix that in the fourth column locate the filters area filters limit the results displayed in the view and we can use this to our advantage here by showing node titles only from blog entries and not every type of node click the   icon to add a filter as before scroll down to the defaults add filters section select node from the groups select box to limit the list of options to only those exposed by node module scroll down and select the node type field and click add  in the settings page that appears leave operator as is one of and select blog entry under node type  click update when finished now by scrolling down to live preview  you ll see that the list only shows blog entries adding context with arguments while filters are very useful for limiting the results of a view when the condition is always consistent for example a view of blog entry nodes should always be filtered by the blog entry type something filters can t do is smart decisionmaking based on the page context in our case we want the view to display a different list of blog entries when looking at a post by user admin than we do when looking at a post by user member and filters won t be able to help luckily there s another way to filter a view s content  arguments  through arguments views are able to obtain additional context typically via dynamic urls with ids in them and can take this context into consideration when displaying the view let s walk through adding and configuring an argument to our view so that we can change its contents based on post author in the third column locate the arguments area click the   icon to add an argument because we are basing the view around content authors  this time under groups select user  check user uid and click add  the defaults configure argument user uid settings page has a lot going on but only a few things that need our attention the title field here unlike the title field under basic settings  can be based upon the context that the view is being displayed in change the title to recent entries by 1 1 will later be expanded to the user s name based on the user uid argument when the view is displayed under action to take if argument is not present  there are a variety of options ranging from displaying a 404 or a 403 page to simply displaying all values in the view in our case if an argument isn t specified which it won t be since this view will be displayed in a sidebar block not as a page with its own url we want to give it a default one to act on select provide default argument  assuming javascript is enabled in your browser you should now get another selection for default argument type  select user id from url  which will then provide a new option  also look for a node and use the node author  select it this will cause views to first see if it can figure out a user id from the current url for example user 1 if it can t it will instead check to see if the current page is a node page such as node 42 and if so take the user id from the node s author field instead validator options provide a useful way to control what kind of arguments your view will accept select user as the validator  by default changing this setting will check the incoming argument and ensure it s a valid user id if not the view will be hidden from the page once you have changed the argument s title default argument and validator options click update to save your changes you ll notice that now the live preview no longer shows anything did we just break the view fortunately no it s merely abiding by our wishes to hide itself if there is no valid user id given to it try entering a 1 in the arguments box and clicking preview  you should now see a list of only user 1 s blog entries creating the block so the live preview is now showing basically what we want there s just one problem we have no way to stick what we ve done so far into a sidebar block let s fix that by adding a new display  in the first column under defaults  there is a select box containing entries such as page   feed  and yes  block  select block and click add display  there s not much else to do here as far as views is concerned under block settings  click the none link next to admin and fill in a description for the block in the administrative interface such as recent blog entries by author and click update  save your work by clicking the save button at the bottom of the views interface you should receive a message that the view has been saved next navigate to the blocks interface and drag the recent blog entries by author block to the right sidebar region or similar and click save blocks  you ll notice this appeared to do nothing no block shows in the sidebar but remember we are looking at an adminitrative page we are not looking at a page that would provide a user id context navigate to the main blog listing and click on an entry there you should now see a sidebar block titled something like recent entries by admin with a list of blog entries beneath it finishing touches there are still a few remaining things to do before our view is complete for example we said that the block was to show recent blog entries but instead it s showing them in the order they were entered with oldest on top additionally even unpublished entries are showing in the list currently return to the recentblogentries view edit page  add an additional filter by clicking the   icon in the filters section in the fourth column change groups to node and select node published  click add  under the published selection choose yes and click update  to handle sorting locate the sort criteria area just above filters and click the   icon there under groups  again select node  from the list of options check node post date and click add  in the settings page change sort order to descending  this will place the newer posts on top of the older ones click update when finished finally  save the view for your new settings to take effect  ',0),(113,'help',' view types the view type describes how this view is stored views is capable of

used to filter the view and in that sense they have a very close relationship to filters but that isn t necessarily true for every argument arguments can be used for any purpose really the extent of what the argument does is up to the developer of the argument but the arguments that come with views are almost entirely filters a typical use of an argument might be to reduce a view to a single node a single user or nodes with a given taxonomy term action to take if argument is not present ignore the argument is removed from the view as though it weren t there and all results will be displayed

view with those arguments summaries have their own style handlers as well as options the default summary style simply displays a list of arguments with a count of entries found per argument this special mode is a very powerful part of views provide default if no argument is given a default argument can be selected the method of choosing the default argument is selectable and pluggable wildcards all arguments have a wildcard which is an argument that means to use all values in practice it is the same as ignore above where the argument is simply removed and the view is created without the argument the wildcard title is used in titles and breadcrumb trails default arguments default argument selection is available only if the action to take is provide default   when that is selected a new fieldset will appear letting you choose what the default argument will be views provides the following default selectors by default but other modules may add more fixed entry you may directly enter what the argument will be this is not a variable it will always be the same argument node id from url this will attempt to find a node id from the url and is primarily useful for the node id argument though other arguments that use node ids such as the cck node reference argument will find it useful too for example when visiting the path node 1 or node 1 edit it will know that the 1 in that path is a node id and use it user id from url like node id from url this will attempt to find a user id from the path it also includes an option to look for a node and use the node author as the user id user id from logged in user you can use this to easily default a menu item to the logged in user for example if you created the path blogs and gave it a user id argument with this default blogs would go to the user s own blogs and blogs 1 would go to user id 1 s blogs please bear in mind that the selection of default argument happens only if an argument is not provided if using a display that has no argument source such as a block this will always be used however if using a display that reads arguments from the url this will happen only if the url did not contain an argument argument validation arguments can also have validators which are pluggable systems used to ensure that arguments fit within certain parameters when a validator is chosen it may provide some settings for the validator including the action to take if an argument is presented but it fails to validate these actions are generally the same as the default actions above excluding the ability to provide another default if a view provides a menu option such as a tab if the argument does not validate the tab will not appear this sytem can have other validators plugged in by default views provides basic validation ensures that the argument is present a php null value from eg php default argument code will invalidate node ensure that the argument is a valid node id you may select which types of node the validator will accept taxonomy term ensure that the argument is a valid taxonomy term this includes options to limit to specific vocabularies and can transform the argument to the right type

form item to let you select which relationship they will use they will default to using no relationship at all the main example of the relationship that is there by default is the node user relationship every node has an author and if a node is in the query the user who wrote that node is automatically made available note the author considers it an error that this relationship is automatic but by the time it was realized this was in error it was too late to change it a similar relationship that is not automatically made available is for node revisions each revision has its own author which is the user who made the revision by adding the node revision user relationship all of the user fields sorts filters and arguments available to a user will now be available for the revision author when a relationship is added to the view all applicable items will gain a relationship select box where you can choose which version of that particular item you wish to use this can be illustrated with an example a comment view contains the relationships comment node and comment user this means that all the fields for the node that a comment is attached to are available and all the user fields for that node author also become available the other relationship makes fields for the author of the comment available very often not the author of the node when you add the user name field you will be presented with a select box either the node relationship or the user relationship must be selected because there are two possible user names in the view to choose from another example of relationships involves the files table in drupal files are related to users but files are not necessarily related to nodes however the uploadmodule allows some files to be attached to nodes the only way for views to deal with this discrepancy is with relationships when creating a node view it s possible to add an uploaded files relationship to get file data for nodes that were attached

directory clear the theme registry see the instructions for how to do this your new template should now operate assuming you picked a nicely named template that includes the view name that template should now be active for your view a good example is viewsviewlistfoobartplphp which would work for a view named foobar you can now modify this template all you like for any template that uses fields the fields will be in array in order to use this effectively you will need to understand enough php to fetch data from an array this is a place where the devel module can really help you because you can use its dsm function right in your template to see what variables it uses there is an alternative to dsm that works without devel module but it s a bit longer to use for example i placed the

view had three fields node nid node title user name the contents of the row variable included these fields in precisely the order that i had arranged them to using the views rearrange link also worth noting though is that each field also has an identifier so it can easily be pulled out of the row should i want to display it differently using php print row title would print just the title for that row please remember that i m doing this inside the loop so this will get repeated for every row of the view the ids used to fetch items from the array id  row title  can be quickly and easily looked up on the theme information page once a field has been added to the view its id will not change but note that if there are two title fields in a view one will be title and the other will be title1 in order to prevent namespace collisions the important thing here is that views does provide ids views doesn t tell you what these ids are but it s easy to get them by dumping the row data and doing a simple visual inspection views does guarantee that these ids will not change unless you actually add a new field and remove the existing one in which case title above would become title1  the basic fields template the most common template people will need to rewrite is the simple viewsviewfieldstplphp which is the template used by the fields row style and all it does is display a simple list of

to have fine control over the template by placing your fields precisely where and how you want relax though if you know what your fields are you can rewrite this if you end up writing your own html the only part that is really important is the content for each field we know from above that you can get the id for each field on the theme information page from the view in the header for the template we can see that the fields are all in the fields array and each field is an object that leads us to this php print fields someid content assuming you replace someid with an id found on the

interface and a large set of new features which greatly expand upon the original featureset of views 1 this document is a sidebyside comparison of views 1 versus views 2 from a user s perspective detailing the ui changes some new ways to perform old tasks the cool new features of views 2 and how these features can be used to address some of the shortcomings of views 1 admin interface the first thing that pops out after you install views 2 is the radically different admin interface  views 2 admin interface compared to the old comfy views 1 interface  views 1 admin interface the new admin interface performs the same functions as the old listing all the views in the system providing links to add or import views and a link to views tools but has been compacted with each view displayed as a paragraph stylerow compared to the table of views 1 and set of filters on top to ease locating views among a large list contexthelp is available by clicking the small blue questionmark icon contexthelp in views 2 is provided by the advanced help module so make sure to install that together with installing views 2 the small blue help icons will be available in various parts of the views ui in particular look for them as part of the description of a display  when setting style options and in various editing sections such as path   menu and the like several new attributes of each view are visible in the filter header  tag  this is just another label for organizing and sorting views tags can be any text views that are provided by modules will often be tagged together to make it easy to find them tags are also added to your template suggestions so take care what you set here for example setting the tag page will give all your views the page template display  in views 1 each view query was tied to its display in other words your fields sorts filters and arguments could only be displayed in the single page or block display provided in the view definition in views 2 view displays have been decoupled from view queries it is now possible to have multiple page block and feed displays from a single view more on view displays later type  views 2 view types are radically different from views 1 types views 1 types basically defined how the node list displays were styled  you had full nodes teaser list table view and so on in views 2 view display styles have been broken out into the separate style attribute view types now refer to the primary table on which information for the query will be retrieved which controls what arguments fields sort criteria and filters are available views 2 view types are discussed later adding a view so let s jump in and add a view for this example we re going to create a user view which will display a list of users adding a view the first step in adding a view is simply entering a name only alphanumeric characters no spaces a description tag and the view type to get the user view we selected the user radio button configuring the new view this might be the 2nd whoa moment as the interface here is also completely revamped from views 1x the best way to summarize is to say all the pieces from the views 1x interface are still therejust in different places fields arguments sort critera and filters are all still there there just in new ajaxyflavours let s start by adding some fields  adding fields clicking on the icon next to the word fields unfurls a section beneath the view information with all the available fields grouped by comment file node node revision taxonomy and user and probably a few others this is a general paradigm for the views 2 interface clicking on a widget or link unfurls a section beneath the view information with the relevant interface usually what is being edited will be hilited in yellow as well when adding items you can use the groups dropdown box to show only a subset of the fields available according to the above groups or select all to see all fields available which is what was selected when the section unfurled for our example we re selecting the user group and adding the user email   user name and user picture fields adding fields once we add our fields they show up in the fields section of the interface we will be walked through each field we added so keep clicking update  even if you don t make changes to the field and you will see the next one the fields we added can be rearranged by clicking the up down icon right next to the add icon we used earlier we can also remove a field using the same interface rearranging fields from here the fields can be dragged up and down by grabbing the little drag handle on the left and moving them where you like making a change to any part of the view by clicking update usually triggers a refresh of the view preview which is conveniently located right below the main interface views preview now that we have some fields set up we can turn our attention to basic settings for the view it s important to note that all the interface elements pertain to the current display selected for the view as mentioned before a view can have multiple displays the first time you create a view you ll be manipulating the default display you can add displays using the add display button whose basic settings are completely different from each other this lets you have as many displays of a view as you would like all sharing items such as sort criteria filters and arguments but different display settings like title style fields and pager settings also any display you add automatically inherits display settings from the default display initially so you can keep a core of common settings in your default display and add additional settings for every other display adding a page display let s stick with the default display and twiddle some settings we can set the title to user view 1 and the style to table as mentioned earlier view styles in views 2 correspond more to view types in views 1 remember list table teasers full nodes  selecting a views 1 view type in views 2 view styles control how a view display looks these styles are significantly different from the types in views 1 in particular types have been broken up there is now the style as well as the row style which focus on different parts of the output a breakdown of view output we change the style by clicking on the current style on the left hand side of the view information area selecting a views 2 display style we re given the style options of grid   list   table and unformatted  additional display styles can be added by modules which have views style plugins  choosing a style reveals a settings button which you can click to configure the style you ve chosen in the shot below we ve selected and are configuring the table style which

hookviewshandlers  and hookviewsplugins   these hooks are kept in a file named modulenameviewsinc this file is automatically included upon need so there is no need to try and include this in hookinit or any other method of including inc files this file should store hookviewsdata hookviewsdataalter hookviewsplugins hookviewshandlers as well as any other hooks and subsidiary data that will only be

hookviewsapi  in the main module file this module should return array of information the following items may be returned  api this must appear it should be the oldest api version that your module can work with if views is currently running an older version of the api it will ignore your module s views integration this is a good thing as it will prevent code crashes at the expense of your module s functionality disappearing you may find the current views api version by calling viewsapiversion  which is implemented at the top of viewsmodule this version numbering starts at 20 every time changes are made to the views handlers and plugins or other aspects of the views api the number will tick up by either 001 01 1 or 1 depending upon how major the changes are note that viewsapiversion  was introduced in views 20rc2 and may not exist prior to that version you may use functionexists to test to see if this function is there often these versions are basically compatible with each other and views won t care if your module implements 2000 2001 2002 etc your module can request that it won t work with any version older than a given version however views will determine itself if a newer version will work path if your views inc files are not in the same directory as the module file then return the full path here you should probably use something like drupalgetpath module yourmodulename includepath  ',0),(148,'help',' describing tables to views tables are described to views via hookviewsdata which returns an array of table information keyed by the name of the table for example if your module is describing three tables foo bar and baz your array will look like this data array foo array info here bar array info here baz array info here the key should be the actual database name of the table not including prefix but it can be an alias as long as the join information explained later contains the real name of the table each item in the array should be a field in the table with the exception of a special information section called table example data foo array table array info about the table described later bar array info about the field named bar ie foobar baz array info about the field named baz ie foobaz once you get down to an array that contains actual data that piece of the array will often be referred to as the definition the table section each table should have a table section in it which is used to set default information for the table such as the group as well as the very important joins and whether or not this is a base table first there are several items that are actually for fields but can be placed here so that all fields within the table inherit them group the name of the group this item will be with in the ui this is displayed as group title for example node node id taxonomy term description etc it is important to be consistent with groups because the ui sorts by group and allows filtering by group to find fields as well title the actual name of the field it should be concise and descriptive help a longer description to help describe what the field is or does it should try to be only a line or two so as not to clutter the ui in general having title and help at the table level doesn t make a lot of sense but usually every item in a table is in the same group thus it is very common to define the group data foo table group t foo  base table if your table is a base table meaning it can be the primary central table for a view to use you can declare it to be a base table this primarily provides ui information so that it can be selected for example advertise this table as a possible base table data node table base array field nid title t node help t nodes are a drupal site s primary content weight 10 the following tags are available in the field the primary key field for this table for views to treat any table as a base table it must have a primary field for node this is the nid for users this is the uid etc without a single primary key field ie not a composite key views will not be able to utilize the table as a base table if your table does not have a primary key field it is not too difficult to just add a serial field to it usually title the title of this table in the ui it should be singular and describe the object that this table contains from the perspective of the user help a short piece of text to describe what object this table contains database if this table is held in a different database from your drupal database specify it as a string in the exact same format as the settingsphp file this is a special purpose variable that will probably be only used in site specific code and it must be the same database type as your drupal database  also don t try to join it to any table that isn t in the same database that ll just create all kinds of silly errors for example in settingsphp for your site your drupal site database needs to be called default dburl default mysqli user pass host drupaldb dburl budget mysqli user pass host otherdb then when you are describing the external database in your base table you would write something like this data table table base array field primary key title t field name help t field description database budget weight 10  linking your table to existing base tables for views to use your table it has to either be a base table or know how to link to an existing base table or sometimes both views uses this information to create a path to the base table when the table is added to the query views will walk along this path adding all tables required into the query how termdata joins to node in the above example to use these with node as the base table both termdata and termnode need to be defined and they each need a join handler for node data termdata table join node array lefttable termnode leftfield tid field tid the above can be read as in order to join to the node table the termdata table must first link to the termnode table and they join on the tid field when adding this table to the query for a node view views will look at this and then look for the termnode table data termnode table join node array leftfield nid field nid above the fact that lefttable is left out lets us know that termnode links directly to the node table using the nid field on both sides of the join quite a few more fields are available in this definition handler the name of the handler object to use defaults to viewsjoin you may create custom join handlers that may or may not use any of the data below as they see fit table table to join this is optional and should only be used if the table being referenced is an alias field field to join on this is required lefttable the next step toward the final destination if this is the final destination it may be omitted leftfield the field to join to on the left side this is required type either left default or inner extra either a string that s directly added or an array of items each item is itself an array field field or formula operator similar to filters this is the operator such as etc defaults to or in value must be set if an array operator will be defaulted to in numeric if true the value will not be surrounded in quotes and d will be used for its placeholder extra type how all the extras will be combined either and or or defaults to and describing fields on tables aside from the special table tag each table can also have an unlimited number of field designations these correspond roughly to fields on the table though it is very common to use nonfields to display data that isn t directly in a field such as data arrived from formulae or special links related to the object the table is part of each field is described in the view data with an array keyed to the database name of the field this array may contain some information fields plus an entry in each of the five types of items views has per field argument field filter relationship sort for example data node nid array title t nid help t the node id of the node the help that appears on the ui information for displaying the nid field array handler viewshandlerfieldnode click sortable true information for accepting a nid as an argument argument array handler viewshandlerargumentnodenid name field title the field to display in the summary numeric true validate type nid information for accepting a nid as a filter filter array handler viewshandlerfilternumeric information for sorting on a nid sort array handler viewshandlersort the above example describes the nid field on the node table providing 4 of the 5 handlers note that while field is normally expected to be the database name of the field it doesn t have to be you can use an alias which is how you get multiple handlers

typical of smaller sites and hobby sites however views may also be stored directly in the code as default views which simply means they re available by default modules often come with views that are specific to the module data but it s also possible and highly recommended that sites which have separate development and production sites export their views into default views in a sitespecific module this makes it very easy to transfer views from dev to production without making database changes creating a module first create a directory in sites all modules for your new module call it whatever you like but for this example we will call it mymodule  in this directory create a mymodulemodule file it can be empty for now but it should at least contain an opening php tag php id it should not contain a closing tag as the closing tag is not required and anything after the closing tag such as a space or a linefeed will be displayed directly to the browser and can potentially cause problems the module file will contain functions and drupal hooks hooks are specially named functions that drupal will call in order to get your module s response at certain times while generating pages the only function you will need for this exercise is the viewsapi hook that tells views that this module supports the views api and what version function mymoduleviewsapi return array api 20 for other uses you may well add additional functions second you need to create a mymoduleinfo file id name my module description my site specific module core 6x once you have these two files set up you should be able to activate your new module at the administer site building modules page exporting your views the easiest way to do this is to activate the viewsexport module and navigate to administer views tools bulk export place a check next to each view that you want in your module type the module name into the text field and click export this will create the entire hookviewsdefaultviews  function for you you can also export individual views if you do this keep in mind that this export does not include the line that adds the exported view into the larger views array views view name view to place this into your hookviewsdefaultviews  you will need to place that after the view and make sure the function returns views at the end placing your exported views into your module cut and paste the entire output of the bulk export tool into mymoduleviewsdefaultinc and be sure to put a php at the top of the file so that the webserver knows that it s php code then visit the views tools page and clear the views cache your views should now be listed as overridden on the view list page if you revert these views they will be removed from the database but will remain in code theming your views in your module you can theme these views in the module and not need to rely on the theme to do this at all and in fact the theme can continue to override these just like it ordinarily would even if your module provides a theme this is very useful for distributing a module where the view needs to look just so to do this you need to implement hooktheme  in your module function mymoduletheme existing

gotchas in doing this that you must be aware of when referring to a template filename you always use dashes in the name ie  viewsviewviewnamedisplayidtplphp  however when referring to the hook or

flow handlers are objects much of the time the base handlers will work but often you ll need to override the handler for something one typical handler override will be viewshandlerfilteroperatorin which allows you to have a filter select from a list of options you ll need to override this to provide your list handlers have two distint code flows the ui flow and the view building flow for the query flow handler construct create the initial handler at this time it is not yet attached to a view it is here that you can set basic defaults if needed but there will be no knowledge of the environment yet handler setdefinition set the data from hookviewsdata relevant to the handler handler init attach the handler to a view and usually provides the options from the display handler prequery run prior to the query stage to do early processing handler query do the bulk of the work this handler needs to do to add itself to the query fields being the only handlers concerned with output also have an extended piece of the flow handler prerender called prior to the actual rendering this allows handlers to query for extra data the entire resultset is available here and this is where items that have multiple values per record can do their extra query for all of the records available there are several examples of this at work in the code handler render this does the actual work of rendering the field most handlers are just extensions of existing classes with a few tweaks that are specific to the field in question for example filter by node type class viewshandlerfilternodetype extends viewshandlerfilterinoperator function getvalueoptions if isset this valueoptions this valuetitle t node type types nodegettypes foreach types as type info options type info name this valueoptions options  viewshandlerfilterinoperator provides a simple mechanism to set the list used and the rest of the handler is perfectly fine for this handlers are stored in their own files for these files to be loaded by views on demand they must first be registered since views core handlers are also loaded this way it s imperative that your module also implement this pattern in order to prevent code crashes when your handler s parent class is not yet available to register handlers you must implement hookviewshandlers   this hook returns an array with two keys the first key is info which contains the modulename which is only necessary if you re registering handlers on behalf of another module such as what views does and path  which is the search path to find the files this path is only necessary if your files will not be stored in the same directory as the module file the other key is handlers which contains a full array of handlers and the information for each handler the key to each handler array is the name of the handler class it can contain  parent the class that this handler extends this is important to make sure that the parent class is included before your handler class without this you may cause people s sites to crash in a difficult to recover state be sure you get this right  file the filename the handler is in by default this will be classnameinc however you can have multiple similar handlers together in one file however because there is only one parent please be sure that the parentage on these handlers matches otherwise you will run into whitescreens as not all parents will be loaded you can see examples of this function in any of the various moduleviewsinc files in the views modules directory the best place to learn more about handlers and how they work is to explore the views api site and use existing handlers as a guide and a model understanding how viewshandler and its child classes work is handy but you can do a lot just following these models you can also explore the views module directory particularly nodeviewsinc please note that while all handler names in views are prefixed with views you should use your own module s name to prefix your handler names in order to ensure namespace safety note that the basic pattern for handler naming goes like this module handler type tablename fieldname sometimes table and fieldname are not appropriate but something that resembles what the table field would be can be used ',0),(151,'help',' how views plugins work in views a plugin is a bit like a handler but plugins are not directly responsible for building the query instead they are objects that are used to display the view or make other modifications there are 6 types of plugins in views display display plugins are responsible for controlling where a view lives page and block are the most common displays as well as the ubiquitous default display which is likely what will be embedded style style plugins control how a view is displayed for the most part they are object wrappers around theme templates row style row styles handle each individual record from a node argument default argument default plugins allow pluggable ways of providing arguments for blocks views includes plugins to extract node and user ids from the url additional plugins could be used for a wide variety of tasks argument validator validator plugins can ensure arguments are valid and even do transformations on the arguments access access plugins are responsible for controlling access to the view plugins are registered by implementing hookviewsplugins  in your modulenameviewsinc file and returning an array of data the array will look something like this return array display array list of display plugins style array list of style plugins row array list of row style plugins argument default array list of argument default plugins argument validator array list of argument validator plugins access array list of access plugins each plugin will be registered with an identifier for the plugin plus a fairly lengthy list of items that can define how and where the plugin is used here is an example from views core node array title t node help t display the node with standard node view handler viewspluginrownodeview path drupalgetpath module views modules node not necessary for most modules theme viewsviewrownode base array node only works with node as base uses options true type normal of particular interest is the path directive which works a little differently from handler registration each plugin must define its own path rather than relying on a global info for the paths also there is an optional parent directive which is automatically filled in to be the base parent for the plugin type usually this is enough but if your plugin derives from something other than the base it must be filled in for example feed array title t feed help t display the view as a feed such as an rss feed handler viewsplugindisplayfeed parent page so it knows to load the page plugin inc file uses hook menu true use ajax false use pager false accept attachments false admin t feed help topic displayfeed note that unlike handler registration where parentage is referred to by object name with plugins it is referred to by the unique plugin identifier please be sure to prefix your plugin identifiers with your module name to ensure namespace safety after all two different modules could try to implement the grid2 plugin and that would cause one plugin to completely fail todo finish this document

features module enables the capture and management of features in drupal a feature is a collection of drupal entities which taken together satisfy a certain usecase features provides a ui and api for taking different site building components from modules with exportables and bundling them together in a single feature module a feature module is like any other drupal module except that it declares its components eg views contexts cck fields etc in its info file so that it can be checked updated or reverted programmatically examples of features might be a blog a pressroom an image gallery an ecommerce tshirt store installation features can be installed like any other drupal module place it in the modules directory for your site and enable it on the admin build modules page to take full advantage of some of the workflow benefits provided by features you should install drush 1 basic usage features is geared toward usage by developers and site builders it is not intended to be used by the general audience of your drupal site features provides tools for accomplishing two important tasks task 1 export features you can build features in drupal by using site building tools that are supported see a short list under the compatibility section once you ve built and configured functionality on a site you can export it into a feature module by using the feature create page at admin build features create task 2 manage features the features module also provides a way to manage features through a more targeted interface than admin build modules the interface at admin build features shows you only feature modules and will also inform you if any of their components have been overridden if this is the case you can also recreate features to bring the module code up to date with any changes that have occurred in the database including custom code and adding to your feature once you ve exported your feature you will see that you have several files myfeatureinfo myfeaturemodule myfeature inc you can add custom code eg custom hook implementations other functionality etc to your feature in myfeaturemodule as you would with any other module do not change or add to any of the features inc files unless you know what you are doing these files are written to by features on updates so any custom changes may be overwritten using features to manage development because features provides a centralized way to manage exportable components and write them to code it can be used during development in conjunction with a version control like svn or git as a way to manage changes between development staging and production sites an example workflow for a developer using features is to 1 make configuration changes to a feature on her local development site 2 update her local feature codebase using drush featuresupdate 3 commit those changes using svn commit 4 roll out her changes to the development site codebase by running svn update on the server other collaborating developers can also get her changes with svn update 5 reverting any configuration on the staging site to match the updated codebase by running drush featuresrevert 6 rinse repeat features also provides integration with the diff 3 module if enabled to show differences between configuration in the database and that in code for site builders interested in using features for development enabling the diff module and reading apitxt for more details on the inner workings of features is highly recommended drush usage features provides several useful drush commands drush features list all the available features on your site and their status drush featuresexport feature name component list write a new feature in code containing the components listed drush featuresupdate feature name

to help you realise some common use case scenarios and to spruce up your workflow interface as far as the ui goes this module replaces the traditional workflow radio buttons by either a dropdown or singleaction buttons the latter feature contextsensitive labels potentially employing replacement tokens if desired for a more intuitive user experience for further flexibility all three ui styles radio dropdown or singleaction buttons are available as a block the module also defines some extra tokens that may be used with rules to invoke actions like sending reminder emails when content was not updated or a workflow did not transition state for some time using these tokens you won t need php snippets let s say we have a basic workflow with states draft review and live traditionally authors and moderators must select the next state by pressing the correct radiobutton and clicking submit experience from the field suggests that not everybody finds this intuitive rather than having to think in terms of state transitions users prefer to press a button with a an explanatory label that clearly expresses what is going to happen using this module authors will find on their edit forms clearly labeled buttons for instance save as draft don t submit and submit for publication in old workflowspeak submit for publication was represented by radio buttons plus a submit button which would read less intuitively as transition workflow state from draft to review similarly with this module moderators will see on their edit form buttons like reject and return to author john ie review draft and publish this or go live with this review live this module also defines a replacement token node workflowstateage which when used in a scheduled rule set makes it easier to invoke actions when a workflow state not transitioned after a specified elapsed time no php code is required when using this token see drupalorg project workflowextensions for full instructions on how to do this using rules installation installation is like any other module uncompress the targz file and drop it into the sites all modules subdirectory visit administer site building modules tick the box in front of the module name and press save configuration or use drush for full control over the labels to put on your workflow buttons also install workflow named transitions configuration if you have workflow named transitions installed highly recommended for full flexibility visit administer site building workflow and click the edit labels tab at the top of the page to enter your custom labels with the token module installed you may use replacement tokens in your custom labels for instance reject submission return to authorname or transition to workflow workflownewstatename in addition there are a couple of selfexplanatory configuration options at administer site configuration workflow extensions and one permission at administer user management permissions if you have views enabled a workflow dashboard menu item will appear in the navigation menu this view displays on a single page workflow state transition forms for all nodes on your system that are subject to workflow naturally you can modify and extend this view to your heart s content finally this module also makes the state change form used on the workflow tab available as a block giving you more control over where users may change workflow state a usecase is a troubleticket system whereby operators can view the ticket status and update it on the same page minimising clicks using the block visibility controls you may place the block on any page that provides a node context typically the node pages or more specifically the node view page to prevent the edit and other tabs from also displaying the block tick show if the following php code returns true and enter if your theme does not have any block regions to suit your estethic requirements you can instead insert the line below in the nodetplphp file of your theme for instance immediately above or below the line containing print content workflow comments optional in the workflow module may be made mandatory at the adminisiter configuration workflow extensions page the permission to edit workflow log comments after they ve been entered may be set at administer user management permissions this edit workflow log permission comes into play in the workflow history view available via the navigation menu if you have the views module enabled the workflow history view presents an edit link for each workflow log comment provided the user has the edit workflow log permission usage users will find that the workflow radio buttons previously used to instigate state transitions are now replaced by either a dropdown selector or by more intuitive
