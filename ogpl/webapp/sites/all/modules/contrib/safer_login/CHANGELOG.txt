===================
Changelog for Safer Login
===================

9-18-2010
  Libraries API is now supported (but optional).  This way, the jquery_md5
  plugin can be installed outside of the module's directory, making it much
  easier to upgrade.  Special thanks to perusio!
  (issue: [#888836])

8-19-2010
  Adjusted the way the AJAX callback is called from javascript so it will
  still work w/o clean URLs enabled (thanks m_sabal! issue: [#888138] )
  
  Fixed a bug/oversight on my part where the system might accidentally
  not let a valid user log in if they shared the same password with another
  user. (Thanks again, m_sabal! issue: [#888092])

8-12-2010
  Fixed a bug where, if the site was in offline mode, safer login actually
  prevents admin from logging in.  So, while the site is in offline mode,
  the safer login module simply gets bypassed.


8-05-2010
  Added a simple check to see if you have both the login block and the
  login page displaying at the same time, which would cause a problem.
  Unlikely, perhaps, but I figured I might as well do it just in case.

7-22-2010
  Fixed a bug where it was not wanting to log in correctly after failing
  validation.  Had to do with setting and unsetting session variables.
  
  Also, added ability to have "minimal protection."  Still double-hashes
  passwords, but does not use a unique salt, so password managers and the like
  will work with it (though obviously, this is less secure).
  
  Fixed a bug where it was not working well when caching was enabled.  It now
  works fine with caching.


7-19-2010
  Added a simple function to let the administrator test to make sure the
  javascript MD5 function produces the exact same output as the PHP md5
  function.  I wrote this mostly for my own testing, but decided to leave
  it in for educational reasons.
  

7-18-2010
  Initial commit of Safer Login.
